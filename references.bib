However, many property optimization tasks require the generation of novel but realistic materials compositions. In this study, we describe a way to generate compositions of hybrid organic\textendash inorganic crystals through adapting Augmented CycleGAN, a novel generative model that can learn many-to-many relations between two domains. Specifically, we investigate the problem of composition change upon amine swap: for a specific chemical system (set of elements) crystalized with amine A, how would the product chemical compositions change if it is crystalized with amine B? By training with limited data from Cambridge Structural Database, our model can generate realistic chemical compositions for hybrid crystalline materials. The Augmented CycleGAN model can also utilize abundant unpaired data (compositions of different chemical systems), a feature that traditional supervised methods lack. The generated compositions can be used for many tasks, for example, as input fed to a classifier that predicts structural dimensionality.},

Nonequilibrium materials synthesis is emblematic of complex, resource-intensive experimentation whose acceleration would be a watershed for materials discovery. We demonstrate accelerated exploration of metastable materials through hierarchical autonomous experimentation governed by the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent (SARA). SARA integrates robotic materials synthesis using lateral gradient laser spike annealing and optical characterization along with a hierarchy of AI methods to map out processing phase diagrams. Efficient exploration of the multidimensional parameter space is achieved with nested active learning cycles built upon advanced machine learning models that incorporate the underlying physics of the experiments and end-to-end uncertainty quantification.

In addition, a major engineering challenge is to design new proteins in a principled and methodical way. Current computational modeling methods for protein design are slow and often require human oversight and intervention. Here, we apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the task of generating protein structures, toward application in fast de novo protein design. We encode protein structures in terms of pairwise distances between {$\carriagereturn$}-carbons on the protein backbone, which eliminates the need for the generative model to learn translational and rotational symmetries. We then introduce a convex formulation of corruption-robust 3D structure recovery to fold the protein structures from generated pairwise distance maps, and solve these problems using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. We test the effectiveness of our models by predicting completions of corrupted protein structures and show that the method is capable of quickly producing structurally plausible solutions.},

We introduce Exp2SimGAN, an unsupervised image-to-image ML model to match simulated and experimental data. To train, Exp2SimGAN only requires a set of experimental data and a set of (not necessarily corresponding) simulated data. Once trained, it can convert a simulated dataset into one that resembles an experiment, and vice versa. We demonstrate that Exp2SimGAN can be used to match simulated and experimental two- and three-dimensional inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, enabling the analysis of experimental INS data using supervised ML. Finally, we provide a domain of application measure for Exp2SimGAN, allowing us to assess the likelihood that Exp2SimGAN will be successful on a specific dataset. Exp2SimGAN is a step towards analysis of experimental data using supervised ML models trained on physics-based simulations.},

The Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) program called for integrating computational tools to establish linkages along process\textendash structure\textendash property\textendash performance chains. The Materials Genome Initiative called for integrating experiments and computations within data science frameworks as a strategy to accelerate the materials development cycle. While these frameworks and paradigms have been quite influential, traditional ICME or data science-based approaches tend to have some limitations, mainly when querying the materials space is costly and very little information is available. Bayesian methods are more suitable in this context due to their efficiency gains. To this end, the materials discovery problem is framed as a Bayesian optimization (BO). Different examples in which BO has been applied to solve materials discovery problems are presented. The methods/examples discussed include BO under model uncertainty, multi-information source BO, multi-objective and multi-constraint BO, and batch BO. Bayesian Materials Discovery is a promising area of research that is likely to become more influential as more attention is put on autonomous materials discovery platforms. Therefore, a discussion is provided on the potential development of such methods to increase the ability of existing platforms in materials discovery. The ultimate goal is to pave the way to autonomous materials discovery.},

In this work, we create pairwise distance matrices between compounds via Element Mover's Distance (ElMD) and use these to create 2D density-aware embeddings for chemical compositions via Density-preserving Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (DensMAP). Because ElMD assigns distances between compounds that are more chemically intuitive than Euclidean-based distances, the compounds can then be clustered into chemically homogeneous clusters via Hierarchical Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN*). In combination with performance predictions via Compositionally-Restricted Attention-Based Network (CrabNet), we introduce several new metrics for materials discovery and validate DiSCoVeR on Materials Project bulk moduli using compound-wise and cluster-wise validation methods. We visualize these via multi-objective Pareto front plots and assign a weighted score to each composition that encompasses the trade-off between performance and density-based chemical uniqueness. In addition to density-based metrics, we explore an additional uniqueness proxy related to property gradients in DensMAP space. As a validation study, we use DiSCoVeR to screen materials for both performance and uniqueness to extrapolate to new chemical spaces. Top-10 rankings are provided for the compound-wise density and property gradient uniqueness proxies. Top-ranked compounds can be further curated via literature searches, physics-based simulations, and/or experimental synthesis. Finally, we compare DiSCoVeR against the naive baseline of random search for several parameter combinations in an adaptive design scheme. To our knowledge, this is the first time automated screening has been performed with explicit emphasis on discovering high-performing, novel materials.},

This is a type of solution degeneracy that often exists physics-based simulations and wetlab experiments, but constraining these degeneracies is often unsupported or difficult-to-implement in many optimization packages, requiring additional time and expertise. So, is the increase in efficiency worth the cost of implementation? We demonstrate that the compactness of a search space (to what extent degenerate solutions and nonsolutions are removed) can have a significant effect on Bayesian optimization search efficiency via the Ax platform. As our optimization task, we use a physics-based particle packing simulation with seven to nine tunable parameters, depending on the search space compactness, that represent three truncated, discrete log-normal distributions of particle sizes. This physics-based simulation exhibits three qualitatively different degeneracy types: size-invariance, compositional-invariance, and permutation-invariance. The degeneracies are reflected in the outcomes being identical when: 1. all particle sizes are multiplied by a constant factor, 2. the fractional prevalences of the particle types sum to unity, and 3. sets of log-normal distribution parameters are swapped with each other, respectively. This simulation provides fertile ground for assessing the impact of multiple constraints on search efficiency, with a total of eight search space types which ranges from none up to all three constraints imposed simultaneously. Contrary to intuition, we find that, on average, the most compact search space performs worse than the least compact search space ((0.692 {$\pm$} 0.036) vs. (0.699 {$\pm$} 0.016) , respectively) over 50 iterations due to the interactions of the non-linear size-invariance degeneracy with other degeneracy types. The most efficient search space in terms of both predicted and validated outcomes is the combination of the composition and permutation constraints, resulting in a mean packing fraction of (0.728 {$\pm$} 0.010) over 50 iterations, where randomly sampled volume fractions are typically no less than 0.6. We recommend that optimization practitioners in the physical sciences carefully consider the impact of removing search space degeneracies on search efficiency prior to running expensive optimization campaigns.},

The rapid screening of their properties is a challenging task, especially with multiple components defining the targeted properties. In this work we present a platform for accelerated automated screening of viscous graphene suspensions for optimal electrical conductivity. Using an Opentrons OT2 robotic auto-pipettor, we tested 3 most industrially significant surfactants \textendash{} PVP, SDS and T80 \textendash{} by fabricating 288 samples of graphene suspensions in aqueous hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. Enabled by our custom motorized 4-point probe measurement setup and computer vision algorithms, we then measured the electrical conductivity of every sample and identified that the highest performance is achieved for PVP-based samples, peaking at 10.8 mS cm               -1               without annealing. The automation of the experimental procedure allowed us to perform the majority of the experiments using robots, while the involvement of human researchers was kept to minimum. Overall the experiment was completed in less than 18 hours, only 3 of which involved humans.},

Thereby, different raw materials are mixed and processed to meet predefined and often competing targets. During this procedure, applied experimental campaigns not only require expert knowledge, but, depending on the complexity, also cause a high consumption of resources and costs. In the present work, a fully automized milli-fluidic laboratory driven by the Thomsen sampling efficient multiobjective optimization (TSEMO) algorithm was designed. The methodology was successfully applied to optimize the aggregation process of a liquid formulation consisting of whey protein isolate, NaCl and CaCl2. Within 48~h 90 experiments could be performed without human intervention, resulting in a Pareto front formed by a set of 18 optimal recipes. It is thus a successful demonstration of an actively learning, self-driving food formulation process.},

B\'edard               et al.               present a flow-based reaction platform that carries out this laborious task automatically. By using feedback from integrated analytics, the system converges on optimal conditions that can then be applied with high precision afterward. A series of modules with heating, cooling, mixing, and photochemical capabilities could be configured for a broad range of reactions. These include homogeneous and heterogeneous palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling, reductive amination, and the generation of sensitive intermediates under an inert atmosphere.

The system software controls the user-selected reagents and unit operations (reactors and separators), processes reaction analytics (high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy), and conducts automated optimizations. The capabilities of this system are demonstrated in high-yielding implementations of C-C and C-N cross-coupling, olefination, reductive amination, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S               N               Ar), photoredox catalysis, and a multistep sequence. The graphical user interface enables users to initiate optimizations, monitor progress remotely, and analyze results. Subsequent users of an optimized procedure need only download an electronic file, comparable to a smartphone application, to implement the protocol on their own apparatus.},

In the present study we employ an integrated computational and experimental approach to search for new thermoelectric materials. High-throughput first principles calculations of thermoelectric transport coefficients are used to screen sulfide compounds conforming to the boundary conditions of abundant and innocuous components. A further computational screening step of substitutional defects is introduced, whereby SnS doped with monovalent cations is identified as having favorable transport properties. By silver doping of SnS under S-rich conditions an electric conductivity more than an order of magnitude higher than reported previously is realized. The obtained thermoelectric power-factor at room temperature is comparable to the state of the art for thermoelectric materials based on earth abundant, non-toxic elements. The high-throughput screening of extrinsic defects solves a long standing bottleneck in search of new thermoelectric materials. We show how the intrinsic carrier concentration in the low-temperature phase of SnSe is two orders of magnitude higher than in SnS. We furthermore find that the carrier concentration in SnSe can still be further optimized by silver doping.},

The data publication service simplifies the process of copying data to a secure storage location, assigning data a citable persistent identifier, and recording custom (e.g., material, technique, or instrument specific) and automatically-extracted metadata in a registry while the data discovery service will provide advanced search capabilities (e.g., faceting, free text range querying, and full text search) against the registered data and metadata. The MDF services empower individual researchers, research projects, and institutions to (I) publish research datasets, regardless of size, from local storage, institutional data stores, or cloud storage, without involvement of third-party publishers; (II) build, share, and enforce extensible domain-specific custom metadata schemas; (III) interact with published data and metadata via representational state transfer (REST) application program interfaces (APIs) to facilitate automation, analysis, and feedback; and (IV) access a data discovery model that allows researchers to search, interrogate, and eventually build on existing published data.

In this context, reliable uncertainty estimates are important for assessing confidence in predictions and enabling decision making. However, machine learning models can produce badly calibrated uncertainty estimates and it is therefore crucial to detect and handle uncertainty carefully. In this work we extend a message passing neural network designed specifically for predicting properties of molecules and materials with a calibrated probabilistic predictive distribution. The method presented in this paper differs from previous work by considering both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a unified framework, and by recalibrating the predictive distribution on unseen data. Through computer experiments, we show that our approach results in accurate models for predicting molecular formation energies with well calibrated uncertainty in and out of the training data distribution on two public molecular benchmark datasets, QM9 and PC9. The proposed method provides a general framework for training and evaluating neural network ensemble models that are able to produce accurate predictions of properties of molecules with well calibrated uncertainty estimates.},

  abstract = {The ability to optically monitor a chemical reaction and generate an in situ readout is an important enabling technology, with applications ranging from the monitoring of reactions in flow, to the critical assessment step for combinatorial screening, to mechanistic studies on single reactant and catalyst molecules. Ideally, such a method would be applicable to many polymers and not require only a specific monomer for readout. It should also be applicable if the reactions are carried out in microdroplet chemical reactors, which offer a route to massive scalability in combinatorial searches. We describe a convenient optical method for monitoring polymerization reactions, fluorescence polarization anisotropy monitoring, and show that it can be applied in a robotically generated microdroplet. Further, we compare our method to an established optical reaction monitoring scheme, the use of Aggregation-Induced Emission (AIE) dyes, and find the two monitoring schemes offer sensitivity to different temporal regimes of the polymerization, meaning that the combination of the two provides an increased temporal dynamic range. Anisotropy is sensitive at early times, suggesting it will be useful for detecting new polymerization ``hits'' in searches for new reactivity, while the AIE dye responds at longer times, suggesting it will be useful for detecting reactions capable of reaching higher molecular weights.},

Deep learning has recently garnered considerable interest in materials predictive tasks with low model errors when dealing with large materials data. However, deep learning models suffer in the small data regime that is common in materials science. Here we develop the AtomSets framework, which utilizes universal compositional and structural descriptors extracted from pre-trained graph network deep learning models with standard multi-layer perceptrons to achieve consistently high model accuracy for both small compositional data ({$<$}400) and large structural data ({$>$}130,000). The AtomSets models show lower errors than the graph network models at small data limits and other non-deep-learning models at large data limits. They also transfer better in a simulated materials discovery process where the targeted materials have property values out of the training data limits. The models require minimal domain knowledge inputs and are free from feature engineering. The presented AtomSets model framework can potentially accelerate machine learning-assisted materials design and discovery with less data restriction.},

  abstract = {Mapping materials science problems onto computational frameworks suitable for machine learning can accelerate materials discovery. Combining proposed crystal site feature embedding (CSFE) representation with convolutional and extensive deep neural networks, we achieve a low mean absolute test error of 3.7 meV/ atom and 0.069 eV on density functional theory energies and band gaps of mixed halide perovskites. We explore how a small amount of cadmium doping can potentially be applied in solar cell design and sample the large chemical space by using a variational autoencoder to discover interesting perovskites with band gaps in the ultraviolet and infrared. Additionally, we use CSFE to explore chemical spaces and small doping concentrations beyond those used for training. We further show that CSFE has a mean absolute test error of 7 meV/atom and 0.13 eV for total energies and band gaps for 2D perovskites and discuss its adaptability for exploration of an even wider variety of chemical systems.},

DL allows analysis of unstructured data and automated identification of features. The recent development of large materials databases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction in particular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely leveraged synthetic data enabled by high-quality forward models as well as by generative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level overview of deep learning methods followed by a detailed discussion of recent developments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging, spectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we discuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical modeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly available software and datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of recent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantification in this field and a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas for DL methods in materials science.},

  abstract = {The process of automating chemistry involves a wide variety of considerations that are often overlooked.           ,              Automation has become an increasingly popular tool for synthetic chemists over the past decade. Recent advances in robotics and computer science have led to the emergence of automated systems that execute common laboratory procedures including parallel synthesis, reaction discovery, reaction optimization, time course studies, and crystallization development. While such systems offer many potential benefits, their implementation is rarely automatic due to the highly specialized nature of synthetic procedures. Each reaction category requires careful execution of a particular sequence of steps, the specifics of which change with different conditions and chemical systems. Careful assessment of these critical procedural requirements and identification of the tools suitable for effective experimental execution are key to developing effective automation workflows. Even then, it is often difficult to get all the components of an automated system integrated and operational. Data flows and specialized equipment present yet another level of challenge. Unfortunately, the pain points and process of implementing automated systems are often not shared or remain buried deep in the SI. This perspective provides an overview of the current state of automation of synthetic chemistry at the benchtop scale with a particular emphasis on core considerations and the ensuing challenges of deploying a system. Importantly, we aim to reframe automation as decidedly not automatic but rather an iterative process that involves a series of careful decisions (both human and computational) and constant adjustment.},

Utilizing off-the-shelf components, we developed a closed-loop system capable of carrying out parallel autonomous process optimization experiments in batch with significantly reduced cycle times. Upon implementation of our system in the autonomous optimization of a palladium-catalyzed stereoselective Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, we found that the definition of a set of meaningful, broad, and unbiased process parameters was the most critical aspect of a successful optimization. In addition, we found that categorical parameters such as phosphine ligand were vital to determining the reaction outcome. To date, categorical parameter selection has relied on chemical intuition, potentially introducing an element of bias into the experimental design. In seeking a systematic method for the selection of a diverse set of phosphine ligands fully representative of the chemical space, we developed a strategy that leveraged computed molecular descriptor clustering analysis. This strategy allowed for the successful autonomous optimization of a stereoselective Suzuki-Miyaura coupling between a vinyl sulfonate and an arylboronic acid to selectively generate the E-product isomer in high yield.},

  abstract = {Pairing prediction and robotic synthesis                            Progress in automated synthesis of organic compounds has been proceeding along parallel tracks. One goal is algorithmic prediction of viable routes to a desired compound; the other is implementation of a known reaction sequence on a platform that needs little to no human intervention. Coley               et al.               now report preliminary integration of these two protocols. They paired a retrosynthesis prediction algorithm with a robotically reconfigurable flow apparatus. Human intervention was still required to supplement the predictor with practical considerations such as solvent choice and precise stoichiometry, although predictions should improve as accessible data accumulate for training.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaax1566                        ,              An automated synthesis platform conducts reactions on the basis of a human-devised workflow informed by a retrosynthesis algorithm.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               The ability to synthesize complex organic molecules is essential to the discovery and manufacture of functional compounds, including small-molecule medicines. Despite advances in laboratory automation, the identification and development of synthetic routes remain a manual process and experimental synthesis platforms must be manually configured to suit the type of chemistry to be performed, requiring time and effort investment from expert chemists. The ideal automated synthesis platform would be capable of planning its own synthetic routes and executing them under conditions that facilitate scale-up to production goals. Individual elements of the chemical development process (design, route development, experimental configuration, and execution) have been streamlined in previous studies, but none has presented a path toward integration of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), expert refined chemical recipe generation, and robotically executed chemical synthesis.                                         RATIONALE               We describe an approach toward automated, scalable synthesis that combines techniques in artificial intelligence (AI) for planning and robotics for execution. Millions of previously published reactions inform the computational design of synthetic routes; expert-refined chemical recipe files (CRFs) are run on a robotic flow chemistry platform for scalable, reproducible synthesis. This development strategy augments a chemist's ability to approach target-oriented flow synthesis while substantially reducing the necessary information gathering and manual effort.                                         RESULTS               We developed an open source software suite for CASP trained on millions of reactions from the Reaxys database and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The software was designed to generalize known chemical reactions to new substrates by learning to apply retrosynthetic transformations, to identify suitable reaction conditions, and to evaluate whether reactions are likely to be successful when attempted experimentally. Suggested routes partially populate CRFs, which require additional details from chemist users to define residence times, stoichiometries, and concentrations that are compatible with continuous flow. To execute these syntheses, a robotic arm assembles modular process units (reactors and separators) into a continuous flow path according to the desired process configuration defined in the CRF. The robot also connects reagent lines and computer-controlled pumps to reactor inlets through a fluidic switchboard. When that is completed, the system primes the lines and starts the synthesis. After a specified synthesis time, the system flushes the lines with a cleaning solvent, and the robotic arm disconnects reagent lines and removes process modules to their appropriate storage locations.               This paradigm of flow chemistry development was demonstrated for a suite of 15 medicinally relevant small molecules. In order of increasing complexity, we investigated the synthesis of aspirin and secnidazole run back to back; lidocaine and diazepam run back to back to use a common feedstock; (S)-warfarin and safinamide to demonstrate the planning program's stereochemical awareness; and two compound libraries: a family of five ACE inhibitors including quinapril and a family of four nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including celecoxib. These targets required a total of eight particular retrosynthetic routes and nine specific process configurations.                                         CONCLUSION               The software and platform herein represent a milestone on the path toward fully autonomous chemical synthesis, where routes still require human input and process development. Over time, the results generated by this and similar automated experimental platforms may reduce our reliance on historical reaction data, particularly in combination with smaller-scale flow-screening platforms. Increased availability of reaction data will further enable robotically realized syntheses based on AI recommendations, relieving expert chemists of manual tasks so that they may focus on new ideas.                                                   Planning and execution.                   A robotically reconfigurable flow chemistry platform performs multistep chemical syntheses planned in part by AI.                                                                         ,              The synthesis of complex organic molecules requires several stages, from ideation to execution, that require time and effort investment from expert chemists. Here, we report a step toward a paradigm of chemical synthesis that relieves chemists from routine tasks, combining artificial intelligence\textendash driven synthesis planning and a robotically controlled experimental platform. Synthetic routes are proposed through generalization of millions of published chemical reactions and validated in silico to maximize their likelihood of success. Additional implementation details are determined by expert chemists and recorded in reusable recipe files, which are executed by a modular continuous-flow platform that is automatically reconfigured by a robotic arm to set up the required unit operations and carry out the reaction. This strategy for computer-augmented chemical synthesis is demonstrated for 15 drug or drug-like substances.},

Trained with materials from the ICSD database, our GAN model can generate hypothetical materials not existing in the training dataset, reaching a novelty of 92.53\% when generating 2 million samples. The percentage of chemically valid (charge-neutral and electronegativity-balanced) samples out of all generated ones reaches 84.5\% when generated by our GAN trained with such samples screened from ICSD, even though no such chemical rules are explicitly enforced in our GAN model, indicating its capability to learn implicit chemical composition rules to form compounds. Our algorithm is expected to be used to greatly expand the range of the design space for inverse design and large-scale computational screening of inorganic materials.},

In this work we propose MORBO, a scalable method for multi-objective BO over high-dimensional search spaces. MORBO identifies diverse globally optimal solutions by performing BO in multiple local regions of the design space in parallel using a coordinated strategy. We show that MORBO significantly advances the state-of-the-art in sample efficiency for several high-dimensional synthetic problems and real world applications, including an optical display design problem and a vehicle design problem with 146 and 222 parameters, respectively. On these problems, where existing BO algorithms fail to scale and perform well, MORBO provides practitioners with order-of-magnitude improvements in sample efficiency over the current approach.},

  abstract = {Innovations in batteries can require years of experimentation for design and optimization. We report an autonomous approach to the optimization of a battery electrolyte that uses machine learning coupled to a robotic test-stand to perform hundreds of sequential experiments. We search for mixtures of salts in aqueous electrolytes with high electrochemical stability using Bayesian optimization. In 40 hours of experimentation testing for 140 electrolyte formulas, we converge on a non-intuitive optimal electrolyte. The optimum is a mixed-anion sodium electrolyte that is more stable than a benchmark electrolyte, despite lower salt content, contrary to the known design principle. The precision and repeatability of the robotic test-stand distinguishes formulations that human-guided design may have missed. Our result demonstrates the possibility of integrating robotics with machine learning to discover novel battery materials. We provide a dataset characterizing 251 aqueous electrolytes containing LiNO3, LiClO4, Li2SO4, NaNO3, NaClO4, and Na2SO4 that includes conductivities, pHs, and electrochemical responses on platinum.},

  abstract = {Abstract               Materials exploration and development for three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies is slow and labor-intensive. Each 3D printing material developed requires unique print parameters be learned for successful part fabrication, and sub-optimal settings often result in defects or fabrication failure. To address this, we developed the Additive Manufacturing Autonomous Research System (AM ARES). As a preliminary test, we tasked AM ARES with autonomously modulating four print parameters to direct-write single-layer print features that matched target specifications. AM ARES employed automated image analysis as closed-loop feedback to an online Bayesian optimizer and learned to print target features in fewer than 100 experiments. In due course, this first-of-its-kind research robot will be tasked with autonomous multi-dimensional optimization of print parameters to accelerate materials discovery and development in the field of AM. The combining of open-source ARES OS software with low-cost hardware makes autonomous AM highly accessible, promoting mainstream adoption and rapid technological advancement.                                         Impact statement               The discovery and development of new materials and processes for three-dimensional (3D) printing is hindered by slow and labor-intensive trial-and-error optimization processes. Coupled with a pervasive lack of feedback mechanisms in 3D printers, this has inhibited the advancement and adoption of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies as a mainstream manufacturing approach. To accelerate new materials development and streamline the print optimization process for AM, we have developed a low-cost and accessible research robot that employs online machine learning planners, together with our ARES OS software, which we will release to the community as open-source, to rapidly and effectively optimize the complex, high-dimensional parameter sets associated with 3D printing. In preliminary trials, the first-of-its-kind research robot, the Additive Manufacturing Autonomous Research System (AM ARES), learned to print single-layer material extrusion specimens that closely matched targeted feature specifications in under 100 iterations. Delegating repetitive and high-dimensional cognitive labor to research robots such as AM ARES frees researchers to focus on more creative, insightful, and fundamental scientific work and reduces the cost and time required to develop new AM materials and processes. The teaming of human and robot researchers begets a synergy that will exponentially propel technological progress in AM.},

To explore this, we set about designing an open source prototype of a fully automated evolution machine, comprising seven modules. These modules are a droplet generator, droplet transfer, passive and active size sorting, splitter, incubation chamber, reservoir, and injectors, all run together via a LabVIEW (TM) program integration system. Together we aim for the system to be used to drive cycles of droplet birth, selection, fusion, and propagation. As a proof of principle, in addition to the working individual modules, we present data showing the osmotic exchange of glycylglycine containing and pure aqueous droplets, showing that the fittest droplets exhibit higher osomolarity relative to their neighbours, and increase in size compared to their neighbours. This demonstrates the ability of our platform to explore some different physicochemical conditions, combining the efficiency and unbiased nature of automation with our ability to select droplets as functional units based on simple criteria.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            We present a benchmark test suite and an automated machine learning procedure for evaluating supervised machine learning (ML) models for predicting properties of inorganic bulk materials. The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13\,ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm\textemdash namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given \textasciitilde 10               4               or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},

  abstract = {Automation liberates scientific staff from repetitive tasks, decreases the probability of human error and consequently enhances the reproducibility of lab experiments. However, the use of laboratory automation in academic laboratories is limited due to high acquisition costs and the inability to customize off-the-shelf hardware. To address these challenges, we present an Open Source Hardware concept, referred to as OpenWorkstation, to build an assembly line-inspired platform consisting of ready-to-use and customizable modules. In contrast to current standalone solutions, the OpenWorkstation concept enables the combination of single hardware modules \textendash{} each with a specific set of functionalities \textendash{} to a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup. The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications, including pipetting operations for liquids and viscous substances and transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules. We demonstrate the successful application of this concept within a case study by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies and a photo-crosslinker module to initiate photo-induced polymerization of hydrogel solutions. We present a Systems Engineering framework for customized module development, guidance for the design and assembly of the presented modules, and operational instructions on the usage of the workstation. By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a modular technology platform, the OpenWorkstation concept will facilitate efficient and reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, this concept will allow academic groups to improve replicability and reproducibility in cell culture process operations towards more economical and innovative research in the future.},

With this model, over 600\,000 experiments are simulated to optimize an AI-guided material synthesis algorithm.           ,              Autonomous robotic experimentation strategies are rapidly rising in use because, without the need for user intervention, they can efficiently and precisely converge onto optimal intrinsic and extrinsic synthesis conditions for a wide range of emerging materials. However, as the material syntheses become more complex, the meta-decisions of artificial intelligence (AI)-guided decision-making algorithms used in autonomous platforms become more important. In this work, a surrogate model is developed using data from over 1000 in-house conducted syntheses of metal halide perovskite quantum dots in a self-driven modular microfluidic material synthesizer. The model is designed to represent the global failure rate, unfeasible regions of the synthesis space, synthesis ground truth, and sampling noise of a real robotic material synthesis system with multiple output parameters (peak emission, emission linewidth, and quantum yield). With this model, over 150 AI-guided decision-making strategies within a single-period horizon reinforcement learning framework are automatically explored across more than 600\,000 simulated experiments \textendash{} the equivalent of 7.5 years of continuous robotic operation and 400 L of reagents \textendash{} to identify the most effective methods for accelerated materials development with multiple objectives. Specifically, the structure and meta-decisions of an ensemble neural network-based material development strategy are investigated, which offers a favorable technique for intelligently and efficiently navigating a complex material synthesis space with multiple targets. The developed ensemble neural network-based decision-making algorithm enables more efficient material formulation optimization in a no prior information environment than well-established algorithms.},

High-dimensional BO presents a particular challenge, in part because the curse of dimensionality makes it difficult to define\textemdash as well as do inference over\textemdash a suitable class of surrogate models. We argue that Gaussian process surrogate models defined on sparse axis-aligned subspaces offer an attractive compromise between flexibility and parsimony. We demonstrate that our approach, which relies on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, can rapidly identify sparse subspaces relevant to modeling the unknown objective function, enabling sample-efficient high-dimensional BO. In an extensive suite of experiments comparing to existing methods for high-dimensional BO we demonstrate that our algorithm, Sparse AxisAligned Subspace BO (SAASBO), achieves excellent performance on several synthetic and realworld problems without the need to set problemspecific hyperparameters.},

  abstract = {Commercial liquid handling robots are rarely appropriate when tasks change often, which is the case in the early stages of biochemical research. In order to address it, we have developed EvoBot, a liquid handling robot, which is open-source and employs a modular design. The combination of an open-source and a modular design is particularly powerful because functionality is divided into modules with simple, well-defined interfaces, hence customisation of modules is possible without detailed knowledge of the entire system. Furthermore, the modular design allows end-users to only produce and assemble the modules that are relevant for their specific application. Hence, time and money are not wasted on functionality that is not needed. Finally, modules can easily be reused. In this paper, we describe the EvoBot modular design and through scientific experiments such as basic liquid handling, nurturing of microbial fuel cells, and droplet chemotaxis experiments document how functionality is increased one module at a time with a significant amount of reuse. In addition to providing wet-labs with an extendible, open-source liquid handling robot, we also think that modularity is a key concept that is likely to be useful in other robots developed for scientific purposes.},

The number of screening candidates grows infinitely large as the fractional resolution of compositions and the number of included elements increase. The computational infeasibility and probability of overlooking a successful candidate grow likewise. Our approach takes inspiration from neural style transfer and shifts the optimization focus from model parameters to the fractions of each element in a composition. By leveraging a pretrained network with exceptional prediction accuracy (CrabNet) and writing a custom loss function to govern a vector consisting of element fractions, material compositions can be optimized such that a predicted property is maximized or minimized. It is expected that fractional optimization would excel in inverse design problems concerning the effects of dopants and those seeking a balance between competing properties.}

This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy.

Wide band gap (WBG) semiconductors tend to exhibit large breakdown field, allowing high operating voltages. Currently explored WBG materials for power electronics are costly (GaN), difficult to synthesize as high-quality single crystals (SiC) and at scale (diamond, BN), have low thermal conductivity (\$\textbackslash beta\$-Ga\$\_2\$O\$\_3\$), or cannot be suitably doped (AlN). We conduct a computational search for novel semiconductors across 1,340 known metal-oxides using first-principles calculations and existing transport models. We calculate the Baliga figure of merit (BFOM) and lattice thermal conductivity (\$\textbackslash kappa\_L\$) to identify top candidates for n-type power electronics. We find 40 mostly ternary oxides that have higher \$\textbackslash kappa\_L\$ than \$\textbackslash beta\$-Ga\$\_2\$O\$\_3\$ and higher n-type BFOM than SiC and GaN. Among these, several material classes emerge, including 2-2-7 stoichiometry thortveitites and pyrochlores, II-IV spinels, and calcite-type borates. Within these classes, we propose In\$\_2\$Ge\$\_2\$O\$\_7\$, Mg\$\_2\$GeO\$\_4\$, and InBO\$\_3\$ as they are the most favorable for n-type doping based on our preliminary evaluation and could be grown as single crystals or thin film heterostructures.

  abstract = {The experimental search for new thermoelectric materials remains largely confined to a limited set of successful chemical and structural families, such as chalcogenides, skutterudites, and Zintl phases. In principle, computational tools such as density functional theory (DFT) offer the possibility of rationally guiding experimental synthesis efforts toward very different chemistries. However, in practice, predicting thermoelectric properties from first principles remains a challenging endeavor [J. Carrete et al., Phys. Rev. X 4, 011019 (2014)], and experimental researchers generally do not directly use computation to drive their own synthesis efforts. To bridge this practical gap between experimental needs and computational tools, we report an open machine learning-based recommendation engine (http://thermoelectrics.citrination.com) for materials researchers that suggests promising new thermoelectric compositions based on pre-screening about 25 000 known materials and also evaluates the feasibility of user-designed compounds. We show this engine can identify interesting chemistries very different from known thermoelectrics. Specifically, we describe the experimental characterization of one example set of compounds derived from our engine, RE12Co5Bi (RE = Gd, Er), which exhibits surprising thermoelectric performance given its unprecedentedly high loading with metallic d and f block elements and warrants further investigation as a new thermoelectric material platform. We show that our engine predicts this family of materials to have low thermal and high electrical conductivities, but modest Seebeck coefficient, all of which are confirmed experimentally. We note that the engine also predicts materials that may simultaneously optimize all three properties entering into zT; we selected RE12Co5Bi for this study due to its interesting chemical composition and known facile synthesis.},

  abstract = {Many routines in biological experiments require the precise handling of liquid volumes in the range of microliters up to liters. In this paper, we describe a new wireless controller that is adapted to liquid manipulation tasks, in particular when combined with the proposed 3D-printed pumps. It can be built from widely available electronic components and managed with open-source software. The use of peristaltic pumps enables to move volumes from milliliters to liters with a relative error below 1\% or a syringe pump capable of injecting volumes in the range of milliliters with microliter accuracy. The system is remotely controllable over WiFi and easily automated using the MQTT communication protocol. The programming of the microcontroller is performed on the Arduino IDE. The WiFi settings and the calibration value can be easily modified, stored and exported in the form of a JSON file to create a user friendly, plug and play and easily scalable device. Additional sensors or actuators can be added, allowing the system to adapt to various usages. Finally, in addition to its low manufacturing cost and its capability to fit a large variety of tasks involving liquid handling, our system has been specifically designed for research environments where adaptability and repeatability of experiments is essential.},

Specifically, we seek to maximize the strength normalized strain-hardening rate of a dual-phase ferritic/martensitic steel through a multi-information source Bayesian optimal design strategy. We assume that we have multiple sources of information with varying degrees of fidelity as well as cost. The available information from all sources is fused through a reification approach and then a sequential experimental design is carried out. The experimental design seeks not only to identify the most promising region in the materials design space relative to the objective at hand, but also to identify the source of information that should be used to query this point in the decision space. The selection criterion for the source used, accounts for the discrepancy between the source and the `ground truth' as well as its cost. It is shown that when there is a hard constraint on the budget available to carry out the optimization, accounting for the cost of querying individual sources is essential.},

As they stand, both ICME and MGI do not prescribe how to achieve the necessary tool integration or how to efficiently exploit the computational tools, in combination with experiments, to accelerate the development of new materials and materials systems. This paper addresses the first issue by putting forward a framework for the fusion of information that exploits correlations among sources/models and between the sources and ``ground truth.'' The second issue is addressed through a multi-information source optimization framework that identifies, given current knowledge, the next best information source to query and where in the input space to query it via a novel value-gradient policy. The querying decision takes into account the ability to learn correlations between information sources, the resource cost of querying an information source, and what a query is expected to provide in terms of improvement over the current state. The framework is demonstrated on the optimization of a dual-phase steel to maximize its strength-normalized strain hardening rate. The ground truth is represented by a microstructure-based finite element model while three low fidelity information sources\textemdash i.e., reduced order models\textemdash based on different homogenization assumptions\textemdash isostrain, isostress, and isowork\textemdash are used to efficiently and optimally query the materials design space.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic forecasts of continuous variables take the form of predictive densities or predictive cumulative distribution functions. We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.},

Numerical methods are important tools for optimization, but experiment remains the gold standard for studying nonlinear, but critical, mechanical properties such as toughness. To address the vastness of AM design space and the need for experiment, we develop a Bayesian experimental autonomous researcher (BEAR) that combines Bayesian optimization and high-throughput automated experimentation. In addition to rapidly performing experiments, the BEAR leverages iterative experimentation by selecting experiments based on all available results. Using the BEAR, we explore the toughness of a parametric family of structures and observe an almost 60-fold reduction in the number of experiments needed to identify high-performing structures relative to a grid-based search. These results show the value of machine learning in experimental fields where data are sparse.},

A frequently-overlooked modelling consideration in Bayesian optimisation strategies however, is the representation of heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty. In many practical applications it is desirable to identify inputs with low aleatoric noise, an example of which might be a material composition which displays robust properties in response to a noisy fabrication process. In this paper, we propose a heteroscedastic Bayesian optimisation scheme capable of representing and minimising aleatoric noise across the input space. Our scheme employs a heteroscedastic Gaussian process surrogate model in conjunction with two straightforward adaptations of existing acquisition functions. First, we extend the augmented expected improvement heuristic to the heteroscedastic setting and second, we introduce the aleatoric noise-penalised expected improvement (ANPEI) heuristic. Both methodologies are capable of penalising aleatoric noise in the suggestions. In particular, the ANPEI acquisition yields improved performance relative to homoscedastic Bayesian optimisation and random sampling on toy problems as well as on two real-world scientific datasets.

We demonstrate that the CA-robot enabled the observation of a sudden and highly specific response of droplets to slight temperature changes. Six modes of self-propelled droplet motion were identified and classified using a time-temperature phase diagram and probed using a variety of techniques including NMR.

  abstract = {Although extending the reactivity of a given class of molecules is relatively straightforward, the discovery of genuinely new reactivity and the molecules that result is a wholly more challenging problem. If new reactions can be considered unpredictable using current chemical knowledge, then we suggest that they are not merely new but also novel. Such a classification, however, requires an expert judge to have access to all current chemical knowledge or risks a lack of information being interpreted as unpredictability. Here, we describe how searching chemical space using automation and algorithms improves the probability of discovery. The former enables routine chemical tasks to be performed more quickly and consistently, while the latter uses algorithms to facilitate the searching of chemical knowledge databases. Experimental systems can also be developed to discover novel molecules, reactions and mechanisms by augmenting the intuition of the human expert. In order to find new chemical laws, we must seek to question current assumptions and biases. Accomplishing that involves using two areas of algorithmic approaches: algorithms to perform searches, and more general machine learning and statistical modelling algorithms to predict the chemistry under investigation. We propose that such a chemical intelligence approach is already being used and that, in the not-too-distant future, the automated chemical reactor systems controlled by these algorithms and monitored by a sensor array will be capable of navigating and searching chemical space more quickly, efficiently and, importantly, without bias. This approach promises to yield not only new molecules but also unpredictable and thus novel reactivity.},

Importantly for BO problem settings, our method operates in semi-supervised regimes where only few labelled data points are available. We run experiments on three real-world tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the penalised logP molecule generation benchmark using just 3\% of the labelled data required by previous approaches.

For selected properties, availability of large databases has also facilitated application of deep learning (DL) and transfer learning (TL). However, unavailability of large datasets for a majority of properties prohibits widespread application of DL/TL. We present a cross-property deep-transfer-learning framework that leverages models trained on large datasets to build models on small datasets of different properties. We test the proposed framework on 39 computational and two experimental datasets and find that the TL models with only elemental fractions as input outperform ML/DL models trained from scratch even when they are allowed to use physical attributes as input, for 27/39 ({$\approx$}\,69\%) computational and both the experimental datasets. We believe that the proposed framework can be widely useful to tackle the small data challenge in applying AI/ML in materials science.},

  abstract = {For real-world applications, material properties must usually meet multiple requirements, and researchers often spend considerable time designing such materials by trial and error. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) constitutes a promising data-driven solution to accelerate such design problems. As things stand, conceptually different MOBO methods exist for material design problems, such as scalarization- and hypervolume-based methods. However, no standard approach exists to compare how these methods perform and the appropriate choice of MOBO method in each case remains unclear. Herein, a benchmark protocol to compare how conceptually different MOBO methods perform was introduced, based on which the performances of MOBO methods were comprehensively compared using multiple design problems and performance metrics. The benchmark results showed that there was no method that performed best for all combinations of design problems and performance metrics. Moreover, when multiple MOBO methods were compared, the opportunity cost of using each method emerged and it was shown that an inappropriately chosen method can hinder MOBO efficiency. The benchmark results shown here highlight the importance of choosing the right MOBO method and provide guidelines for how this can be done.},

Notably, automated laboratories enhance process quality and intensification while freeing researchers from repetitive tasks. With these societal changes in place, students need to be prepared for the advanced digitization of chemistry and science by teaching fundamental chemistry concepts in combination with emerging Industry 4.0 technologies, including programming and automation. We describe an undergraduate classroom exercise at the interface of chemistry, computer science and engineering based on the development of an autonomous titration platform. Following an inquiry learning ansatz, the exercise focuses on standard titration experiments which are first executed manually, then automatically and finally in full autonomy by a student-designed robotic platform. We demonstrate that the exercise introduced in this work enables students to learn fundamental concepts in analytical chemistry, naturally integrates basic aspects of programming and automation, and as a consequence promotes and reinforces the detailed understanding of experimental processes and measurements. The exercise is designed in a collaborative active learning framework to encourage complex critical thinking and creative problem solving and thus prepares students for the next-generation chemistry laboratories.},

Additional complexity arises for tasks involving experimentation or expensive computations, as the number of evaluated conditions must be kept low. We propose Chimera as a general purpose achievement scalarizing function for multi-target optimization where evaluations are the limiting factor. Chimera combines concepts of               a priori               scalarizing with lexicographic approaches and is applicable to any set of               n               unknown objectives. Importantly, it does not require detailed prior knowledge about individual objectives. The performance of Chimera is demonstrated on several well-established analytic multi-objective benchmark sets using different single-objective optimization algorithms. We further illustrate the applicability and performance of Chimera with two practical examples: (i) the auto-calibration of a virtual robotic sampling sequence for direct-injection, and (ii) the inverse-design of a four-pigment excitonic system for an efficient energy transport. The results indicate that Chimera enables a wide class of optimization algorithms to rapidly find ideal conditions. Additionally, the presented applications highlight the interpretability of Chimera to corroborate design choices for tailoring system parameters.},

In this paper, we outline an approach to understand and explore complex chemical systems using an automated droplet maker to control the composition, size and position of the droplets in a predefined chemical environment. By investigating the spatio-temporal dynamics of the droplets, the aim is to understand how to control system-level emergence of complex chemical behaviour and even view the system-level behaviour as a programmable entity capable of information processing. Herein, we explore how our automated droplet-maker platform could be viewed as a prototype chemical heterotic computer with some initial data and example problems that may be viewed as potential chemically embodied computations.},

Such `Big Scientific Data' comes from the Diamond Light Source and Electron Microscopy Facilities, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility and the UK's Central Laser Facility. Increasingly, scientists are now required to use advanced machine learning and other AI technologies both to automate parts of the data pipeline and to help find new scientific discoveries in the analysis of their data. For commercially important applications, such as object recognition, natural language processing and automatic translation, deep learning has made dramatic breakthroughs. Google's DeepMind has now used the deep learning technology to develop their AlphaFold tool to make predictions for protein folding. Remarkably, it has been able to achieve some spectacular results for this specific scientific problem. Can deep learning be similarly transformative for other scientific problems? After a brief review of some initial applications of machine learning at the RAL, we focus on challenges and opportunities for AI in advancing materials science. Finally, we discuss the importance of developing some realistic machine learning benchmarks using Big Scientific Data coming from several different scientific domains. We conclude with some initial examples of our `scientific machine learning' benchmark suite and of the research challenges these benchmarks will enable.

  abstract = {Optimization strategies driven by machine learning, such as Bayesian optimization, are being explored across experimental sciences as an efficient alternative to traditional design of experiment. When combined with automated laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies enable next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or materials. Although many of these constraints are known a priori, they can be interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and Gryffin such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints via an intuitive and flexible interface. We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and discrete test functions with a diverse set of constraints, demonstrating their flexibility and robustness. In addition, we illustrate their practical utility in two simulated chemical research scenarios: the optimization of the synthesis of o-xylenyl Buckminsterfullerene adducts under constrained flow conditions, and the design of redox active molecules for flow batteries under synthetic accessibility constraints. The tools developed constitute a simple, yet versatile strategy to enable model-based optimization with known experimental constraints, contributing to its applicability as a core component of autonomous platforms for scientific discovery.},

Recent studies show that the Al 2 Fe 3 Si 3 intermetallic compound with a relatively high power factor of {$\sim$}700 {$\mu$}W m -1 K -2 at 400 K is promising for applications in low-cost and nontoxic thermoelectric devices. To accelerate the exploration of the thermoelectric properties of this material in a mid-temperature range and to enhance its power factor, a machine-learning method was employed herein to assist the synthesis of off-stoichiometric samples (namely, Al 23.5+x Fe 36.5 Si 40-x ) of the Al 2 Fe 3 Si 3 compound by tuning the Al/Si ratio. The optimal Al/Si ratio for a high power factor in the mid-temperature range was found rapidly and efficiently, and the optimal ratio of the sample at x = 0.9 was found to increase the power factor at {$\sim$}510 K by about 40\% with respect to that of the initial sample at x = 0.0. The possible mechanism for the enhanced power factor is discussed in terms of the precipitations of the metallic secondary phases in the Al 23.5+x Fe 36.5 Si 40-x samples. Furthermore, the maximum achievable thermal conductivity of Al 2 Fe 3 Si 3 estimated by the Slack model is {$\sim$}10 W m -1 K -1 at the Debye temperature. An avoided-crossing behavior of the acoustic and the low-lying optical modes along several crystallographic directions is found in the phonon dispersion of Al 2 Fe 3 Si 3 calculated by ab initio density functional theory method. These preliminary results suggest that Al 2 Fe 3 Si 3 can have a low thermal conductivity.

Particularly attractive is the application of machine learning methods to the field of materials development, which enables innovations by discovering new and better functional materials. To apply machine learning to actual materials development, close collaboration between scientists and machine learning tools is necessary. However, such collaboration has been so far impeded by the black box nature of many machine learning algorithms. It is often difficult for scientists to interpret the data-driven models from the viewpoint of material science and physics. Here, we demonstrate the development of spin-driven thermoelectric materials with anomalous Nernst effect by using an interpretable machine learning method called factorized asymptotic Bayesian inference hierarchical mixture of experts (FAB/HMEs). Based on prior knowledge of material science and physics, we were able to extract from the interpretable machine learning some surprising correlations and new knowledge about spin-driven thermoelectric materials. Guided by this, we carried out an actual material synthesis that led to the identification of a novel spin-driven thermoelectric material. This material shows the largest thermopower to date.},

The promise of ML models to enable large-scale chemical space exploration can only be realized if it is straightforward to identify when molecules and materials are outside the model's domain of applicability. Established uncertainty metrics for neural network models are either costly to obtain (               e.g.               , ensemble models) or rely on feature engineering (               e.g.               , feature space distances), and each has limitations in estimating prediction errors for chemical space exploration. We introduce the distance to available data in the latent space of a neural network ML model as a low-cost, quantitative uncertainty metric that works for both inorganic and organic chemistry. The calibrated performance of this approach exceeds widely used uncertainty metrics and is readily applied to models of increasing complexity at no additional cost. Tightening latent distance cutoffs systematically drives down predicted model errors below training errors, thus enabling predictive error control in chemical discovery or identification of useful data points for active learning.},

Five alternative measures of similarity between curves are investigated as useful tools to help identify parameters from hysteresis loops with inverse analyses. A new algorithm is presented to calculate the area between curves. Four additional methods are presented from literature, which include the Partial Curve Mapping value, discrete Fre\textasciiacute chet distance, Dynamic Time Warping, and Curve Length approach. These similarity measures are compared by solving a non-linear regression problem resembling a single load-unload cycle. The measures are then used to solve more complicated inverse analysis, where material parameters are identified for a kinematic hardening transversely anisotropic material model. The inverse analysis finds material parameters such that a non-linear FE model reproduces the behavior from five experimental hysteresis loops. Each method was shown to find useful parameters for these problems, and should be considered a viable alternative when sum-of-square based methods may be difficult to implement. It is important to consider multiple similarity measures in cases when it is impossible to obtain a perfect match.},

In parallel, the recent successes in applying ML/AI methods for autonomous systems from robotics through self-driving cars to organic and inorganic synthesis are generating enthusiasm for the potential of these techniques to enable automated and autonomous experiment (AE) in imaging. Here, we aim to analyze the major pathways towards AE in imaging methods with sequential image formation mechanisms, focusing on scanning probe microscopy (SPM) and (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM). We argue that automated experiments should necessarily be discussed in a broader context of the general domain knowledge that both informs the experiment and is increased as the result of the experiment. As such, this analysis should explore the human and ML/AI roles prior to and during the experiment, and consider the latencies, biases, and knowledge priors of the decision-making process. Similarly, such discussion should include the limitations of the existing imaging systems, including intrinsic latencies, non-idealities and drifts comprising both correctable and stochastic components. We further pose that the role of the AE in microscopy is not the exclusion of human operators (as is the case for autonomous driving), but rather automation of routine operations such as microscope tuning, etc., prior to the experiment, and conversion of low latency decision making processes on the time scale spanning from image acquisition to human-level high-order experiment planning.},

In this work, we present Dragonfly, an open source Python library for scalable and robust BO. Dragonfly incorporates multiple recently developed methods that allow BO to be applied in challenging real world settings; these include better methods for handling higher dimensional domains, methods for handling multi-fidelity evaluations when cheap approximations of an expensive function are available, methods for optimising over structured combinatorial spaces, such as the space of neural network architectures, and methods for handling parallel evaluations. Additionally, we develop new methodological improvements in BO for selecting the Bayesian model, selecting the acquisition function, and optimising over complex domains with different variable types and additional constraints. We compare Dragonfly to a suite of other packages and algorithms for global optimisation and demonstrate that when the above methods are integrated, they enable significant improvements in the performance of BO.

The main issues identified are the cost of the current available ELNs, their ease of use (or lack of it) and their accessibility issues across different devices and operating systems. Evidence suggests that whilst scientists willingly make use of generic notebooking software, spreadsheets and other general office and scientific tools to aid their work, current ELNs are lacking in the required functionality to meet the needs of the researchers.

Theoretical simulations have become effective tools for investigating the performance of ion-conductive materials because of advancements of computers and computational codes, respectively. However, it can be significantly expensive to conduct an extensive search using theoretical computations. Further, dynamic conductivity and static stability must be simultaneously satisfied for practical applications. Therefore, in this study, we propose a computational framework that simultaneously optimizes dynamic conductivity and static stability; this is achieved by combining theoretical calculations and the Pareto hyper-volume criterion-based Bayesian multi-objective optimization. In our framework, we iteratively select the candidate material that maximizes the expected increase in the Pareto hyper-volume criterion; this is a standard optimality criterion of multi-objective optimization. We show that ion-conductive materials with high dynamic conductivity and static stability can be efficiently identified by our framework via two case studies on diffusion of oxygen and lithium.},

  abstract = {The field of materials science has seen an explosion in the amount of accessible high quality data. With this sudden surge of data, the application of machine learning (ML) onto materials data has led to great results. Particular success has been found in training models based on chemical formulae. Such models have traditionally focused on learning from density functional theory (DFT) or experimental data. Though some researchers have explored the use of DFT calculated properties as features for learning, this has not gained much traction since the machine learning predictions would be limited by the DFT computation time and accuracy. In this work, we explore the use of a stacked ensemble learning system that combines machine learning from DFT calculations to improve learning on experimental data. This is accomplished by handling the DFT and experimental data separately, training distinct models for each. The DFT models are used to generate a ``predicted DFT'' value for the formulae in the experimental data. A meta-learner\textemdash trained using predictions generated by the experimental models combined with predictions from the DFT models\textemdash is shown to improve root-mean-squared-error by over 9\% in the test data, when compared to a baseline model that only learns from the training data.},

  abstract = {The implementation of automation and machine learning surrogatization within closed-loop computational workflows is an increasingly popular approach to accelerate materials discovery. However, the scale of the speedup associated with this paradigm shift from traditional manual approaches remains an open question. In this work, we rigorously quantify the acceleration from each of the components within a closed-loop framework for material hypothesis evaluation by identifying four distinct sources of speedup: (1) task automation, (2) calculation runtime improvements, (3) sequential learning-driven design space search, and (4) surrogatization of expensive simulations with machine learning models. This is done using a time-keeping ledger to record runs of automated software and corresponding manual computational experiments within the context of electrocatalysis. From a combination of the first three sources of acceleration, we estimate that overall hypothesis evaluation time can be reduced by over 90\%, i.e., achieving a speedup of \$\textbackslash sim\$\$10\textbackslash times\$. Further, by introducing surrogatization into the loop, we estimate that the design time can be reduced by over 95\%, i.e., achieving a speedup of \$\textbackslash sim\$\$15\$-\$20\textbackslash times\$. Our findings present a clear value proposition for utilizing closed-loop approaches for accelerating materials discovery.},

  abstract = {The constant demand for novel functional materials calls for efficient strategies to accelerate the materials discovery, and crystal structure prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks along that direction. In addressing this challenge, generative models can offer new opportunities since they allow for the continuous navigation of chemical space via latent spaces. In this work, we employ a crystal representation that is inversion-free based on unit cell and fractional atomic coordinates and build a generative adversarial network for crystal structures. The proposed model is applied to generate the Mg-Mn-O ternary materials with the theoretical evaluation of their photoanode properties for high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). The proposed generative HTVS framework predicts 23 new crystal structures with reasonable calculated stability and band gap. These findings suggest that the generative model can be an effective way to explore hidden portions of the chemical space, an area that is usually unreachable when conventional substitutionbased discovery is employed.},

This paper highlights some of the philosophical and sociological dimensions that have been found empirically in work conducted with robot scientists - that is, with autonomous robotic systems for scientific discovery. Robot scientists do not supply definite answers to the discussed questions, but rather provide proofs of concept for various ideas. For example, it is not that robot scientists solve the realist/antirealist philosophical debate, but that when working with robot scientists one has to make a philosophical choice - in this case, to assume a realist view of science. There are still few systems for autonomous scientific discovery in existence, and it is too early to generalize and propose new theories. However, being in the midst of... a revolution it is important for the research community to re-examine views pertinent to scientific discovery. This paper highlights how experience with robot scientists could inform discussions in other disciplines, from philosophy of science to computer creativity research.},

Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent advancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to learn the underlying interactions of multiple elements, as well as the relationships among multiple properties, to facilitate property prediction in new composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical Correlation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that seamlessly integrates (i) prediction using only a material's composition, (ii) learning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in multi-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential domains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for prediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69 3-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear composition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training data is available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the discovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results from the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property correlation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The best performance is obtained using H-CLMP with Transfer learning (H-CLMP(T)) wherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of states data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical absorption from composition. H-CLMP(T) aggregates multiple knowledge sources with a framework that is well-suited for multi-target regression across the physical sciences.},

The experiment is designed to facilitate understanding of the basics of the CV technology and its application in chemistry among undergraduate students. The standard chemical procedure of titration has been chosen, since it is well-known to students who completed general chemistry or similar foundation chemistry courses. A significant advantage of CV-based automation is the use of open-source software and readily available electronic devices, as no expensive specialized equipment or proprietary software is required. The experiment can be performed remotely, either live online or with prerecorded videos. The reported technology is accessible to virtually any educational institution as well as to individuals. The proposed technology provides affordable and safe means for remote execution of titration experiments for students with disabilities. Therefore, the proposed experiment is suitable for traditional laboratory instruction as well as remote synchronous or asynchronous course delivery which gained practical importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the proposed CV-based automation opens a new realm of opportunities for rethinking traditional chemistry procedures where computer vision is used to improve performance of standard laboratory instruments and techniques.},

We demonstrate an autonomous materials discovery methodology for functional inorganic compounds which allow scientists to fail smarter, learn faster, and spend less resources in their studies, while simultaneously improving trust in scientific results and machine learning tools. This robot science enables science-over-the-network, reducing the economic impact of scientists being physically separated from their labs. The real-time closed-loop, autonomous system for materials exploration and optimization (CAMEO) is implemented at the synchrotron beamline to accelerate the interconnected tasks of phase mapping and property optimization, with each cycle taking seconds to minutes. We also demonstrate an embodiment of human-machine interaction, where human-in-the-loop is called to play a contributing role within each cycle.

Laboratory automation professionals are academic, commercial and government researchers, scientists and engineers who conduct research and develop new technologies to increase productivity, elevate experimental data quality, reduce lab process cycle times, or enable experimentation that otherwise would be impossible. The most widely known application of laboratory automation technology is laboratory robotics.  More generally, the field of laboratory automation comprises many different automated laboratory instruments, devices (the most common being autosamplers), software algorithms, and methodologies used to enable, expedite and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of scientific research in laboratories. The application of technology in today's laboratories is required to achieve timely progress and remain competitive. Laboratories devoted to activities such as high-throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, automated clinical and analytical testing, diagnostics, large-scale biorepositories, and many others, would not exist without advancements in laboratory automation. Some universities offer entire programs that focus on lab technologies.  For example, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis offers a graduate program devoted to Laboratory Informatics.  Also, the Keck Graduate Institute in California offers a graduate degree with an emphasis on development of assays, instrumentation and data analysis tools required for clinical diagnostics, high-throughput screening, genotyping, microarray technologies, proteomics, imaging and other applications.},

We wondered whether it was possible to explore such processes, in this case crystallization, in a systematic way using an autonomous robotic platform. By performing inorganic reactions in an automated system, and observing the resultant occupied macrostate (crystallization images), we developed a powerful entropy source for generation of true random numbers. Randomness was confirmed using tests described by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (p(uniformity) \textquestiondown\textquestiondown{} 0.0001). Deficit from maximum approximate entropy was found be different between compounds (p(ANOVA) \textexclamdown\textexclamdown{} 0.01), and encryption security of these numbers was found to be greater than that of a frequently used pseudorandom number generator. This means that we can now use randomnumber generation as a probe of the stochastic process, as well as explore potential real-world applications.},

Many available designs, however, may be too complex to fabricate in teaching environments. Presented here is OMIS, the Open Millifluidic Inquiry System, which is a platform for performing small-scale chemical synthesis and analysis. OMIS consists of a 3D printed syringe pump, control hardware based upon the Arduino microcontroller and 3D printed reaction vessels. The OMIS syringe pump utilizes a low-power stepper motor which simplifies the instrument construction and allows for power to be supplied from batteries or the USB port of a computer. The simple design of OMIS allows for the instrument to be fabricated in one day, including the time to 3D print components. The OMIS syringe pump is able to deliver fluids at rates between 60 and 300\,{$\mu$}L/min, depending on syringe size, with a reproducibility of 3\%. Several applications of OMIS are presented, including a demonstration of laminar flow in a 3D printed millifluidic chip, implementation of a low-volume flow-cell cuvette insert and the synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles.},

There are often missing regions or regions that need to be remodeled in protein structures. The process of predicting particular missing regions in a protein structure is called loop modeling. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) in deep learning for loop modeling using the idea of image inpainting. The generative network is to capture the context of the loop region and predict the missing area. The adversarial network is to make the prediction look real and provide gradients to the generative network. The proposed network was evaluated on a common benchmark for loop modeling. Experiments show that our method can successfully predict the loop region and has achieved better performance than the state-of-the-art tools. To our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt of using GAN for any bioinformatics studies.},

However, few have evaluated the efficiency of BO across a broad range of experimental materials domains. In this work, we quantify the performance of BO with a collection of surrogate model and acquisition function pairs across five diverse experimental materials systems. By defining acceleration and enhancement metrics for materials optimization objectives, we find that surrogate models such as Gaussian Process (GP) with anisotropic kernels and Random Forest (RF) have comparable performance in BO, and both outperform the commonly used GP with isotropic kernels. GP with anisotropic kernels has demonstrated the most robustness, yet RF is a close alternative and warrants more consideration because it is free from distribution assumptions, has smaller time complexity, and requires less effort in initial hyperparameter selection. We also raise awareness about the benefits of using GP with anisotropic kernels in future materials optimization campaigns.},

Specifically, we explore the bias induced transformations that underpin the functionality of broad classes of devices and functional materials from batteries and memristors to ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics. Optimization and design of these materials require probing the mechanisms of these transformations on the nanometer scale as a function of the broad range of control parameters such as applied potential and time, often leading to experimentally intractable scenarios. At the same time, often the behaviors of these systems are understood within potentially competing theoretical models, or hypotheses. Here, we develop a hypothesis list that covers the possible limiting scenarios for the domain growth, including thermodynamic, domain wall pinning, and screening limited. We further develop and experimentally implement the hypothesis driven automated experiment in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy, autonomously identifying the mechanisms of the bias induced domain switching. This approach can be applied for a broad range of physical and chemical experiments with relatively low dimensional control parameter space and for which the possible competing models of the system behavior that ideally cover the full range of physical eventualities are known or can be created. These include other scanning probe microscopy modalities such as force distance curve measurements and nanoindentation, as well as materials synthesis and optimization.},

  abstract = {Perovskite photovoltaics (PV) have achieved rapid development in the past decade in terms of power conversion efficiency of small-area lab-scale devices; however, successful commercialization still requires further development of low-cost, scalable, and high-throughput manufacturing techniques. One of the critical challenges of developing a new fabrication technique is the high-dimensional parameter space for optimization, but machine learning (ML) can readily be used to accelerate perovskite PV scaling. Herein, we present an ML-guided framework of sequential learning for manufacturing process optimization. We apply our methodology to the Rapid Spray Plasma Processing (RSPP) technique for perovskite thin films in ambient conditions. With a limited experimental budget of screening 100 process conditions, we demonstrated an efficiency improvement to 18.5\% as the best-in-our-lab device fabricated by RSPP, and we also experimentally found 10 unique process conditions to produce the top-performing devices of more than 17\% efficiency, which is 5 times higher rate of success than the control experiments with pseudo-random Latin hypercube sampling. Our model is enabled by three innovations: (a) flexible knowledge transfer between experimental processes by incorporating data from prior experimental data as a probabilistic constraint; (b) incorporation of both subjective human observations and ML insights when selecting next experiments; (c) adaptive strategy of locating the region of interest using Bayesian optimization first, and then conducting local exploration for high-efficiency devices. Furthermore, in virtual benchmarking, our framework achieves faster improvements with limited experimental budgets than traditional design-of-experiments methods (e.g., one-variable-at-a-time sampling). This framework shows the capability of incorporating researchers' domain knowledge into the ML-guided optimization loop; therefore, it has the potential to facilitate the wider adoption of ML in scaling to perovskite PV manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Domain applicability (DA) is a concept introduced to gauge the reliability of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) predictions. A leading DA metric is ensemble variance, which is defined as the variance of predictions by an ensemble of QSAR models. However, this metric fails to identify large prediction errors in melting point (MP) data, despite the availability of large training data sets. In this study, we examined the performance of this metric on MP data and found that, for most molecules, ensemble variance increased as their structural similarity to the training molecules decreased. However, the metric decreased for ``out-of-domain'' molecules, i.e., molecules with little to no structural similarity to the training compounds. This explains why ensemble variance fails to identify large prediction errors. In contrast, a new molecular similarity-based DA metric that considers the contributions of all training molecules in gauging the reliability of a prediction successfully identified predictions of MP data for which the errors were large. To validate our results, we used four additional data sets of diverse molecular properties. We divided each data set into a training set and a test set at a ratio of approximately 2:1, ensuring a small fraction of the test compounds are out of the training domain. We then trained random forest (RF) models on the training data and made RF predictions for the test set molecules. Results from these data sets confirm that the new DA metric significantly outperformed ensemble variance in identifying predictions for out-of-domain compounds. For within-domain compounds, the two metrics performed similarly, with ensemble variance marginally but consistently outperforming the new DA metric. The new DA metric, which does not rely on an ensemble of QSAR models, can be deployed with any machine-learning method, including deep neural networks.},

Applying the deep learning techniques, we have developed a generative model, which can predict distinct stable crystal structures by optimizing the formation energy in the latent space. It is demonstrated that the optimization of physical properties can be integrated into the generative model as on-top screening or backward propagator, both with their own advantages. Applying the generative models on the binary Bi-Se system reveals that distinct crystal structures can be obtained covering the whole composition range, and the phases on the convex hull can be reproduced after the generated structures are fully relaxed to the equilibrium. The method can be extended to multicomponent systems for multi-objective optimization, which paves the way to achieve the inverse design of materials with optimal properties.},

The Pareto front reports the optimal trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. Here we use a self-driving laboratory, Ada, to define the Pareto front of conductivities and processing temperatures for palladium films formed by combustion synthesis. Ada discovers new synthesis conditions that yield metallic films at lower processing temperatures (below 200 \textdegree C) relative to the prior art for this technique (250 \textdegree C). This temperature difference makes possible the coating of different commodity plastic materials (e.g., Nafion, polyethersulfone). These combustion synthesis conditions enable us to to spray coat uniform palladium films with moderate conductivity (1.1 \texttimes{} 10               5               \,S\,m               -1               ) at 191 \textdegree C.

Self-driving laboratories that iteratively design, execute, and learn from materials science experiments in a fully autonomous loop present an opportunity to accelerate this research process. We report here a modular robotic platform driven by a model-based optimization algorithm capable of autonomously optimizing the optical and electronic properties of thin-film materials by modifying the film composition and processing conditions. We demonstrate the power of this platform by using it to maximize the hole mobility of organic hole transport materials commonly used in perovskite solar cells and consumer electronics. This demonstration highlights the possibilities of using autonomous laboratories to discover organic and inorganic materials relevant to materials sciences and clean energy technologies.},

  abstract = {Many black-box optimization tasks arising in high-stakes applications require riskaverse decisions. The standard Bayesian optimization (BO) paradigm, however, optimizes the expected value only. We generalize BO to trade mean and inputdependent variance of the objective, both of which we assume to be unknown a priori. In particular, we propose a novel risk-averse heteroscedastic Bayesian optimization algorithm (RAHBO) that aims to identify a solution with high return and low noise variance, while learning the noise distribution on the fly. To this end, we model both expectation and variance as (unknown) RKHS functions, and propose a novel risk-aware acquisition function. We bound the regret for our approach and provide a robust rule to report the final decision point for applications where only a single solution must be identified. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAHBO on synthetic benchmark functions and hyperparameter tuning tasks.},

Here, we apply deep learning over ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) analytical data collected from 35 427 individual fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) deprotection reactions performed with an automated fast-flow peptide synthesizer. The integral, height, and width of these time-resolved UV-vis deprotection traces indirectly allow for analysis of the iterative amide coupling cycles on resin. The computational model maps structural representations of amino acids and peptide sequences to experimental synthesis parameters and predicts the outcome of deprotection reactions with less than 6\% error. Our deep-learning approach enables experimentally aware computational design for prediction of Fmoc deprotection efficiency and minimization of aggregation events, building the foundation for real-time optimization of peptide synthesis in flow.},

  abstract = {The modus operandi in materials research and development is combining existing data with an understanding of the underlying physics to create and test new hypotheses via experiments or simulations. This process is traditionally driven by subject expertise and the creativity of individual researchers, who ``close the loop'' by updating their hypotheses and models in light of new data or knowledge acquired from the community. Since the early 2000s, there has been notable progress in the automation of each step of the scientific process. With recent advances in using machine learning for hypothesis generation and artificial intelligence for decision-making, the opportunity to automate the entire closed-loop process has emerged as an exciting research frontier. The future of fully autonomous research systems for materials science no longer feels far-fetched. Autonomous systems are poised to make the search for new materials, properties, or parameters more efficient under budget and time constraints, and in effect accelerate materials innovation. This paper provides a brief overview of closed-loop research systems of today, and our related work at the Toyota Research Institute applied across different materials challenges and identifies both limitations and future opportunities.},

In this manuscript, we use ML to infer the underlying differential equation (DE) from experimental data of degrading organic-inorganic methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite thin films under environmental stressors (elevated temperature, humidity, and light). Using a sparse regression algorithm, we find that the underlying DE governing MAPI degradation across a broad temperature range of 35 to 85\,\textdegree C is described minimally by a second-order polynomial. This DE corresponds to the Verhulst logistic function, which describes reaction kinetics analogous to self-propagating reactions. We examine the robustness of our conclusions to experimental variance and Gaussian noise and describe the experimental limits within which this methodology can be applied. Our study highlights the promise and challenges associated with ML-aided scientific discovery by demonstrating its application in experimental chemical and materials systems.},

In this regard, it is simpler to directly measure the equilibrium pH rather than measure the equilibrium reactant concentrations to calculate the equilibrium pH.

The mathematical model used to derive our equation is based on proton transfer buffer equilibria without requiring the incorporation of electroneutrality considerations. The model consists of a quartic polynomial equation that is derived based solely on the partitioning of H+ among the various buffer components. We tested the accuracy of the model using aqueous solutions with various buffers and measured the equilibrium pH values following the addition of HCl. Our results confirmed the accuracy of our new equation (r2 = 1; measured pH vs. predicted pH), indicating that it quantitatively accounts for the underlying acid-base phenomenology.}

This work presents a framework for learning a continuous representation of materials and building a model for new discovery using latent space representation. The ability of autoencoders to generate experimental materials is demonstrated with vanadium oxides via rediscovery of experimentally known structures when the model was trained without them. Approximately 20,000 hypothetical materials are generated, leading to several completely new metastable VxOy materials that may be synthesizable. Comparison with genetic algorithms suggests computational efficiency of generative models that can explore chemical compositional space effectively by learning the distributions of known materials for crystal structure prediction. These results are an important step toward machine-learned inverse design of inorganic functional materials using generative models.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimisation (BO) has been a successful approach to optimise functions which are expensive to evaluate and whose observations are noisy. Classical BO algorithms, however, do not account for errors about the location where observations are taken, which is a common issue in problems with physical components. In these cases, the estimation of the actual query location is also subject to uncertainty. In this context, we propose an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm for BO problems where both the outcome of a query and the true query location are uncertain. The algorithm employs a Gaussian process model that takes probability distributions as inputs. Theoretical results are provided for both the proposed algorithm and a conventional UCB approach within the uncertain-inputs setting. Finally, we evaluate each method's performance experimentally, comparing them to other input noise aware BO approaches on simulated scenarios involving synthetic and real data.},

We consider optimising neotissue growth in a three-dimensional scaffold during dynamic perfusion bioreactor culture, in the context of bone tissue engineering. The goal is to choose design variables that optimise two conflicting objectives, first, maximising neotissue growth and, second, minimising operating cost. We make novel extensions to Bayesian multiobjective optimisation in the case of one analytical objective function and one black-box, i.e. simulation based and objective function. The analytical objective represents operating cost while the black-box neotissue growth objective comes from simulating a system of partial differential equations. The resulting multiobjective optimisation method determines the tradeoff between neotissue growth and operating cost. Our method exhibits better data efficiency than genetic algorithms, i.e. the most common approach in the literature, on both the tissue engineering example and standard test functions. The multiobjective optimisation method applies to real-world problems combining black-box models with easy-to-quantify objectives such as cost.},

  abstract = {DEMO: https://youtu.be/a8\_sCKVJG2w We are building a robot that automates 3D printers. The finished robot can autonomously remove a finished print job from a 3D printer. Our robot enables 3D printers to print a continuous stream of parts without any need for human assistance. This is accomplished via three of the robot's features: a magnetic end effector that manipulates the 3D printer's print bed; a computer vision system that allows the printer to dynamically locate 3D printers; and a mobile drive train that allows the robot to work in an uncontrolled environment. The robot is designed to be deployed in a 3D printer farm: a facility that contains a large fleet of 3D printers which work together to mass produce parts. With our robot, a 3D printer farm can operate autonomously with no need for human assistance. This drastically increases the throughput of any 3D printer farm. And also it's pretty cool!},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate estimates of machine learning model uncertainties on newly predicted data is essential for understanding the accuracy of the model and whether its predictions can be trusted. A common approach to such uncertainty quantification is to estimate the variance from an ensemble of models, which are often generated by the generally applicable bootstrap method. In this work, we demonstrate that the direct bootstrap ensemble standard deviation is not an accurate estimate of uncertainty and propose a calibration method to dramatically improve its accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this calibration method for both synthetic data and physical datasets from the field of Materials Science and Engineering. The approach is motivated by applications in physical and biological science but is quite general and should be applicable for uncertainty quantification in a wide range of machine learning regression models.},

  abstract = {Evolution via natural selection is governed by the persistence and propagation of living things in an environment. The environment is important since it enabled life to emerge, and shapes evolution today. Although evolution has been widely studied in a variety of fields from biology to computer science, still little is known about the impact of environmental changes on an artificial chemical evolving system outside of computer simulations. Here we develop a fully automated 3D-printed chemorobotic fluidic system that is able to generate and select droplet protocells in real time while changing the surroundings where they undergo artificial evolution. The system is produced using rapid prototyping and explicitly introduces programmable environments as an experimental variable. Our results show that the environment not only acts as an active selector over the genotypes, but also enhances the capacity for individual genotypes to undergo adaptation in response to environmental pressures.},

Some, like oil-in-water droplets, can be seemingly simple models, while able to exhibit complex and unpredictable behaviors. How such simple oil-in-water systems can come together to yield complex and life-like behaviors remains a key question. Herein, we illustrate how the combination of automated experimentation and image processing, physicochemical analysis, and machine learning allows significant advances to be made in understanding the driving forces behind oil-in-water droplet behaviors. Utilizing \textquestiondown 7,000 experiments collected using an autonomous robotic platform, we illustrate how smart automation cannot only help with exploration, optimization, and discovery of new behaviors, but can also be core to developing fundamental understanding of such systems. Using this process, we were able to relate droplet formulation to behavior via predicted physical properties, and to identify and predict more occurrences of a rare collective droplet behavior, droplet swarming. Proton NMR spectroscopic and qualitative pH methods enabled us to better understand oil dissolution, chemical change, phase transitions, and droplet and aqueous phase flows, illustrating the utility of the combination of smart-automation and traditional analytical chemistry techniques. We further extended our study for the simultaneous exploration of both the oil and aqueous phases using a robotic platform. Overall, this work shows that the combination of chemistry, robotics, and artificial intelligence enables discovery, prediction, and mechanistic understanding in ways that no one approach could achieve alone.},

In this work, we develop a computational framework that combines first-principles calculations with alloy and point defect modeling to identify alloy compositions that optimize the electronic, thermal, and defect properties. We apply this framework to design n-type Ba                                2(1-                 x                 )                              Sr                                2                 x                              CdP               2               Zintl thermoelectric alloys. Our predictions of the crystallographic properties such as lattice parameters and site disorder are validated with experiments. To optimize the conduction band electronic structure, we perform band unfolding to sketch the effective band structures of alloys and find a range of compositions that facilitate band convergence and minimize alloy scattering of electrons. We assess the n-type dopability of the alloys by extending the standard approach for computing point defect energetics in ordered structures. Through the application of this framework, we identify an optimal alloy composition range with the desired electronic and thermal transport properties, and n-type dopability. Such a computational framework can also be used to design alloys for other functional applications beyond TE.},

Within these MAPs, one or multiple autonomous feedback loops may aim to optimize materials for certain functional properties or generate new insights. The scope of a given experiment campaign is defined by the range of experiment and analysis actions that are integrated into the experiment framework. Herein we present a method for integrating many actions within a hierarchical experimental laboratory automation and orchestration (HELAO) framework. We demonstrate the capability of orchestrating distributed research instruments that can incorporate data from experiments, simulations, and databases. HELAO interfaces laboratory hardware and software that are distributed across several computers and operating systems for executing experiments, data analysis, provenance tracking, and autonomous planning. Parallelization is an effective approach for accelerating knowledge generation provided that multiple instruments can be effectively coordinated, which we demonstrate with parallel electrochemistry experiments orchestrated by HELAO. Efficient implementation of autonomous research strategies requires device sharing, asynchronous multithreading, and full integration of data management in experiment orchestration, which to the best of our knowledge, is demonstrated for the first time herein.},

Herein, we present a framework capable of general inverse design (not limited to a given set of elements or crystal structures), featuring a generalized invertible representation that encodes crystals in both real and reciprocal space, and a property-structured latent space from a variational autoencoder (VAE). In three design cases, the framework generates 142 new crystals with user-defined formation energies, bandgap, thermoelectric (TE) power factor, and combinations thereof. These generated crystals, absent in the training database, are validated by first-principles calculations. The success rates (number of first-principles-validated target-satisfying crystals/number of designed crystals) ranges between 7.1\% and 38.9\%. These results represent a significant step toward property-driven general inverse design using generative models, although practical challenges remain when coupled with experimental synthesis.},

We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method-dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method-sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path-dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.},

  abstract = {Many high-yielding reactions for forming peptide bonds have been developed but these are complex, requiring activated amino-acid precursors and heterogeneous supports. Herein we demonstrate the programmable one-pot dehydration-hydration condensation of amino acids forming oligopeptide chains in around 50\% yield. A digital recursive reactor system was developed to investigate this process, performing these reactions with control over parameters such as temperature, number of cycles, cycle duration, initial monomer concentration and initial pH. Glycine oligopeptides up to 20 amino acids long were formed with very high monomer-to-oligomer conversion, and the majority of these products comprised three amino acid residues or more. Having established the formation of glycine homo-oligopeptides, we then demonstrated the co-condensation of glycine with eight other amino acids (Ala, Asp, Glu, His, Lys, Pro, Thr and Val), incorporating a range of side-chain functionality.},

In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.},

However, education is lagging. Educators need a low-cost, easy-to-use platform to teach the required skills. Industry can also use such a platform for developing and evaluating autonomous physical science methodologies. We present the next generation in science education, a kit for building a low-cost autonomous scientist. The kit was used during two courses at the University of Maryland to teach undergraduate and graduate students autonomous physical science. We discuss its use in the course and its greater capability to teach the dual tasks of autonomous model exploration, optimization, and determination, with an example of autonomous experimental "discovery" of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.},

This is because the systematic approach required for an experimental search is limited when the number of parameters in a chemical space becomes too large, restricting both exploration and reproducibility. Herein, we present a synthetic strategy to systematically search a very large set of potential reactions, using an inexpensive, high-throughput platform that is modular in terms of both hardware and software and is capable of running multiple reactions with in-line analysis, for the automation of inorganic and materials chemistry. The platform has been used to explore several inorganic chemical spaces to discover new and reproduce known tungsten-based, mixed transition-metal polyoxometalate clusters, giving a digital code that allows the easy repeat synthesis of the clusters. Among the many species identified in this work, the most significant is the discovery of a novel, purely inorganic W24FeIII\textendash superoxide cluster formed under ambient conditions. The modular wheel platform was employed to undertake two chemical space explorations, producing compounds 1\textendash 4: (C2H8N)10Na2[H6Fe(O2)W24O82] (1, \{W24Fe\}), (C2H8N)72Na16[H16Co8W200O660(H2O)40] (2, \{W200Co8\}), (C2H8N)72Na16[H16Ni8W200O660(H2O)40] (3, \{W200Ni8\}), and (C2H8N)14[H26W34V4O130] (4, \{W34V4\}), along with many other known species, such as simple Keggin clusters and 1D \{W11M2+\} chains.},

Genetically inspired optimisation has been used in a range of applications, from catalysis to light emitting materials, but these are not autonomous, and do not use physical mutations. Here we present an autonomously driven materials-evolution robotic platform that can reliably optimise the conditions to produce gold-nanoparticles over many cycles, discovering new synthetic conditions for known nanoparticle shapes using the opto-electronic properties as a driver. Not only can we reliably discover a method, encoded digitally to synthesise these materials, we can seed in materials from preceding generations to engineer more sophisticated architectures. Over three independent cycles of evolution we show our autonomous system can produce spherical nanoparticles, rods, and finally octahedral nanoparticles by using our optimized rods as seeds.},

  abstract = {Developing accurate, transferable and computationally inexpensive machine learning models can rapidly accelerate the discovery and development of new materials. Some of the major challenges involved in developing such models are, (i) limited availability of materials data as compared to other fields, (ii) lack of universal descriptor of materials to predict its various properties. The limited availability of materials data can be addressed through transfer learning, while the generic representation was recently addressed by Xie and Grossman [1], where they developed a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) that provides a unified representation of crystals. In this work, we develop a new model (MT-CGCNN) by integrating CGCNN with transfer learning based on multi-task (MT) learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-CGCNN by simultaneous prediction of various material properties such as Formation Energy ({$\increment$}Ef ), Band Gap (Eg) and Fermi Energy (EF ) for a wide range of inorganic crystals (46774 materials). MTCGCNN is able to reduce the test error when employed on correlated properties by upto 8\%. The model prediction has lower test error compared to CGCNN, even when the training data is reduced by 10\%. We also demonstrate our model's better performance through prediction of end user scenario related to metal/non-metal classification. These results encourage further development of machine learning approaches which leverage multi-task learning to address the aforementioned challenges in the discovery of new materials. We make MT-CGCNN's source code available to encourage reproducible research.},

  abstract = {Gaussian process models are flexible, Bayesian non-parametric approaches to regression. Properties of multivariate Gaussians mean that they can be combined linearly in the manner of additive models and via a link function (like in generalized linear models) to handle non-Gaussian data. However, the link function formalism is restrictive, link functions are always invertible and must convert a parameter of interest to an linear combination of the underlying processes. There are many likelihoods and models where a non-linear combination is more appropriate. We term these more general models Chained Gaussian Processes: the transformation of the GPs to the likelihood parameters will not generally be invertible, and that implies that linearisation would only be possible with multiple (localized) links, i.e a chain. We develop an approximate inference procedure for Chained GPs that is scalable and applicable to any factorized likelihood. We demonstrate the approximation on a range of likelihood functions.},

Such studies use the crystal structures of materials, but material researchers rarely store this information. Thus, we generate chemical compositions without using crystal information. We use a conditional VAE (CondVAE) and a conditional GAN (CondGAN) and show that CondGAN using the bag-of-atom representation with physical descriptors generates better compositions than other generative models. Also, we evaluate the effectiveness of the Metropolis-Hastings-based (MH) atomic valency modification and the extrapolation performance, which is important to material discovery.},

  abstract = {Materials discovery is decisive for tackling urgent challenges related to energy, the environment, health care, and many others. In chemistry, conventional methodologies for innovation usually rely on expensive and incremental strategies to optimize properties from molecular structures. On the other hand, inverse approaches map properties to structures, thus expediting the design of novel useful compounds. In this chapter, we examine the way in which current deep generative models are addressing the inverse chemical discovery paradigm. We begin by revisiting early inverse design algorithms. Then, we introduce generative models for molecular systems and categorize them according to their architecture and molecular representation. Using this classification, we review the evolution and performance of important molecular generation schemes reported in the literature. Finally, we conclude highlighting the prospects and challenges of generative models as cutting edge tools in materials discovery.},

In typical formulations, tens of thousands of ingredients are available for use, yet only a tiny fraction end up in a given formulation. Deformulation, the problem of reverse engineering the precise amounts of each ingredient starting from just a list of ingredients, is similarly challenging but is a key capability for staying up-to-date with industry competitors. Here, we take advantage of a large, curated formulations dataset from CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society, which offers a consistent and highly structured representation of the formulations and the chemical identities of their components to show that a variational autoencoder neural network learns meaningful representations of formulations in various product classes such as antiperspirants and oral care. Furthermore, it can be used in conjunction with a two-step sampling algorithm to generate accurate ingredient amount suggestions for deformulation. Deformulation using a variational autoencoder produces estimates that are significantly more accurate than nearest neighbor methods, extrapolates better to formulations that are significantly different than previously seen formulations, and provides a way to leverage large datasets for industrially relevant capabilities.},

In addition, automation is not typically end-to-end, requiring user intervention to move vials, establish analytical methods for each compound and interpret the raw data. We developed a closed-loop, flexible robotic system with integrated solid and liquid dosing capabilities that relies on computer vision and iterative feedback to successfully measure caffeine solubility in multiple solvents. After initial researcher input ({$<$}2 min), the system ran autonomously, screening five different solvent systems (20-80 min each).

Given the high contemporary importance of homogeneous catalysis in general, and asymmetric catalysis in particular, makes them the most compelling systems for leveraging the power of machine learning (ML). We see an overarching connection between the powerful ML tools such as the transfer learning (TL) used in natural language processing (NLP) and the chemical space, when the latter is described using the SMILES strings conducive for representation learning. We developed a TL protocol, trained on 1 million molecules first, and exploited its ability for accurate predictions of the yield and enantiomeric excess for three diverse reaction classes, encompassing over 5000 transition metal- and organo-catalytic reactions. The TL predicted yields in the Pd-catalyzed Buchwald\textendash Hartwig cross-coupling reaction offered the highest accuracy, with an impressive RMSE of 4.89 implying that 97\% of the predicted yields were within 10 units of the actual experimental value. In the case of catalytic asymmetric reactions, such as the enantioselective               N               ,               S               -acetal formation and asymmetric hydrogenation, RMSEs of 8.65 and 8.38 could be obtained respectively, with the predicted enantioselectivities (\%ee) within 10 units of its true value in {$\sim$}90\% of the time. The method is highly time-economic as the workflow bypasses collecting the molecular descriptors and hence of direct implication to high throughput discovery of catalytic transformations.},

The framework is used to minimize the required computational experiments for the discovery of the targeted materials, performed by a thermodynamically-consistent micromechanical model that predicts the materials response based on its composition and microstructure. The developed scheme features a Bayesian optimal experimental design process that operates in a closed loop. During each iteration of the process, a Gaussian process regression model is constructed based on the available computational data and used to emulate the response of the material in the unexplored regions of the materials design space. The sequential exploration of the materials design space is carried out by using an optimal experiment selection policy based on the expected hyper-volume improvement acquisition function that accounts for the uncertainty on the predictions of the regression model. The results indicate the considerable efficiency of the proposed framework, in discovering the targeted materials, compared with the exhaustive model-driven exploration of the materials design space.},

  abstract = {Clear directions for a robotic platform                            The chemistry literature contains more than a century's worth of instructions for making molecules, all written by and for humans. Steiner               et al.               developed an autonomous compiler and robotic laboratory platform to synthesize organic compounds on the basis of standardized methods descriptions (see the Perspective by Milo). The platform comprises conventional equipment such as round-bottom flasks, separatory funnels, and a rotary evaporator to maximize its compatibility with extant literature. The authors showcase the system with short syntheses of three common pharmaceuticals that proceeded comparably to manual synthesis.

These areas are generally defined by the ability to synthesize complex molecules by the successive iteration of similar sets of reactions, allowing the synthesis of products by the automation of a relatively small palette of standardized reactions. Recent advances in areas such as flow chemistry, oligosaccharide synthesis, and iterative cross-coupling are expanding the number of compounds synthesized by automated methods. However, there is no universal and interoperable standard that allows the automation of chemical synthesis more generally.                                         RATIONALE               We developed a standard approach that mirrors how the bench chemist works and how the bulk of the open literature is reported, with the round-bottomed flask as the primary reactor. We assembled a relatively small array of equipment to accomplish a wide variety of different syntheses, and our abstraction of chemical synthesis encompasses the four key stages of synthetic protocols: reaction, workup, isolation, and purification. Further, taking note of the incomplete way chemical procedures are reported, we hypothesized that a standardized format for reporting a chemical synthesis procedure, coupled with an abstraction and formalism linking the synthesis to physical operations of an automated robotic platform, would yield a universal approach to a chemical programming language. We call this architecture and abstraction the Chemputer.                                         RESULTS               For the Chemputer system to accomplish the automated synthesis of target molecules, we developed a program, the Chempiler, to produce specific, low-level instructions for modular hardware of our laboratory-scale synthesis robot. The Chempiler takes information about the physical connectivity and composition of the automated platform, in the form of a graph using the open-source GraphML format, and combines it with a hardware-independent scripting language [chemical assembly (ChASM) language], which provides instructions for the machine operations of the automated platform. The Chempiler software allows the ChASM code for a protocol to be run without editing on any unique hardware platform that has the correct modules for the synthesis. Formalization of a written synthetic scheme by using a chemical descriptive language (XDL) eliminates the ambiguous interpretation of the synthesis procedures. This XDL scheme is then translated into the ChASM file for a particular protocol. An automated robotic platform was developed, consisting of a fluidic backbone connected to a series of modules capable of performing the operations necessary to complete a synthetic sequence. The backbone allows the efficient transfer of the required chemicals into and out of any module of the platform, as well as the flushing and washing of the entire system during multistep procedures in which the modules are reused multiple times. The modules developed for the system consist of a reaction flask, a jacketed filtration setup capable of being heated or cooled, an automated liquid-liquid separation module, and a solvent evaporation module. With these four modules, it was possible to automate the synthesis of the pharmaceutical compounds diphenhydramine hydrochloride, rufinamide, and sildenafil without human interaction, in yields comparable to those achieved in traditional manual syntheses.                                         CONCLUSION               The Chemputer allows for an abstraction of chemical synthesis, when coupled with a high-level chemical programming language, to be compiled by our Chempiler into a low-level code that can run on a modular standard robotic platform for organic synthesis. The software and modular hardware standards permit synthetic protocols to be captured as digital code. This code can be published, versioned, and transferred flexibly between physical platforms with no modification. We validated this concept by the automated synthesis of three pharmaceutical compounds. This represents a step toward the automation of bench-scale chemistry more generally and establishes a standard aiming at increasing reproducibility, safety, and collaboration.                                                   Abstraction of organic synthesis to the Chemputer software and hardware standards.                   The Chemputer system can perform multistep organic synthesis protocols on the bench by using a modular system with hardware and software standards.                                                                         ,              The synthesis of complex organic compounds is largely a manual process that is often incompletely documented. To address these shortcomings, we developed an abstraction that maps commonly reported methodological instructions into discrete steps amenable to automation. These unit operations were implemented in a modular robotic platform by using a chemical programming language that formalizes and controls the assembly of the molecules. We validated the concept by directing the automated system to synthesize three pharmaceutical compounds, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, rufinamide, and sildenafil, without any human intervention. Yields and purities of products and intermediates were comparable to or better than those achieved manually. The syntheses are captured as digital code that can be published, versioned, and transferred flexibly between platforms with no modification, thereby greatly enhancing reproducibility and reliable access to complex molecules.},

We demonstrate a physics-constrained sequential learning framework to subsequently identify the most stable alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites. We fuse data from high-throughput degradation tests and first-principle calculations of phase thermodynamics into an end-to-end Bayesian optimization algorithm using probabilistic constraints. By sampling just 1.8\% of the discretized CsxMAyFA1\`Ax\`AyPbI3 (MA, methylammonium; FA, formamidinium) compositional space, perovskites centered at Cs0.17MA0.03FA0.80PbI3 show minimal optical change under increased temperature, moisture, and illumination with {$>$}17-fold stability improvement over MAPbI3. The thin films have 3-fold improved stability compared with state-of-the-art multi-halide Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3, translating into enhanced solar cell stability without compromising conversion efficiency. Synchrotron-based X-ray scattering validates the suppression of chemical decomposition and minority phase formation achieved using fewer elements and a maximum of 8\% MA. We anticipate that this data fusion approach can be extended to guide materials discovery for a wide range of multinary systems.},

  abstract = {CONSPECTUS: Millions of years of biological evolution have driven the development of highly sophisticated molecular machinery found within living systems. These systems produce polymers such as proteins and nucleic acids with incredible fidelity and function. In nature, the precise molecular sequence is the factor that determines the function of these macromolecules. Given that the ability to precisely define sequence emerges naturally, the fact that biology achieves unprecedented control over the unit sequence of the monomers through evolved enzymatic catalysis is incredible. Indeed, the ability to engineer systems that allow polymer synthesis with precise sequence control is a feat that technology is yet to replicate in artificial synthetic systems. This is the case because, without access to evolutionary control for finely tuned biological catalysts, the inability to correct errors or harness multiple competing processes means that the prospects for digital control of polymerization have been firmly bootstrapped to biological systems or limited to stepwise synthetic protocols. In this Account, we give an overview of strategies that have been used over the last 5 years in efforts to program polymer synthesis with sequence control in the laboratory. We also briefly explore how the use of robotics, algorithms, and stochastic chemical processes might lead to new understanding, mechanisms, and strategies to achieve full digital control. The aim is to see whether it is possible to go beyond bootstrapping to biological polymers or stepwise chemical synthesis. We start by describing nonenzymatic techniques used to obtain sequence-controlled natural polymers, a field that lends itself to direct application of insights gleaned from biology. We discuss major advances, such as the use of rotaxane-based molecular machines and templated approaches, including the utilization of biological polymers as templates for purely synthetic chains. We then discuss synthetic polymer chemistry, whose array of techniques allows the production of polymers with enormous structural and functional diversity, but so far with only limited control over the unit sequence itself. Synthetic polymers can be subdivided into multiple classes depending on the nature of processes used to synthesize them, such as by addition or condensation. Consequently, varied approaches for sequence control have been demonstrated in the area, including but not limited to click reactions, iterative solid-phase chemistry, and exploiting the chemical affinity of the monomers themselves. In addition to those, we highlight the importance of environmental bias in possible control of polymerization at the single-unit level, such as using catalyst switching or external stimuli. Even the most successful experimental sequence control approach needs appropriate tools to verify its scope and validity; therefore, we devote part of the present Account to possible analytical approaches to sequence readout, starting with well established tandem mass spectrometry techniques and touching on those more applicable to specific classes of processes, such as diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy. Finally, we discuss progress in modeling and automation of sequence-controlled polymers. We postulate that developments in analytical chemistry, bioinformatics, and computer modeling will lead to new ways of exploring the development of new strategies for the realization of sequence control by means of sequence bias. This is the case because treating the assembly of polymers as a network of chemical reactions will enable the development of control strategies that can bias the outcome of the polymer assembly. The grand aim would be the synthesis of complex polymers in one step with a precisely defined digital sequence.},

Minimal artificial replicators have been designed based on molecular recognition, inspired by the template copying of DNA, but none yet have been coupled to compartmentalisation. Here, we present an oil-in-water droplet system comprising an amphiphilic imine dissolved in chloroform that catalyses its own formation by bringing together a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic precursor, which leads to repeated droplet division. We demonstrate that the presence of the amphiphilic replicator, by lowering the interfacial tension between droplets of the reaction mixture and the aqueous phase, causes them to divide. Periodic sampling by a droplet-robot demonstrates that the extent of fission is increased as the reaction progresses, producing more compartments with increased self-replication. This bridges a divide, showing how replication at the molecular level can be used to drive macroscale droplet fission.},

Following these models, a ternary rhenium tungsten carbide and a quaternary molybdenum tungsten borocarbide are selected and synthesized at ambient pressure. High-pressure diamond anvil cell measurements corroborate the machine-learning prediction of the bulk modulus with less than 10\% error, as well as confirm the ultraincompressible nature of both compounds. Subsequent Vickers microhardness measurements reveal that each compound also has an extremely high hardness exceeding the superhard threshold of 40 GPa at low loads (0.49 N).

Object detection techniques can play vital roles in addressing these safety issues; however, state-of-the-art detectors, including single-shot detector (SSD) models, suffer from insufficient accuracy in environments involving complex and noisy scenes. With the aim of improving safety in a surveillance-free laboratory, we report a novel deep learning (DL)-based object detector, namely, DenseSSD. For the foremost and frequent problem of detecting vial positions, DenseSSD achieved a mean average precision (mAP) over 95\% based on a complex dataset involving both empty and solution-filled vials, greatly exceeding those of conventional detectors; such high precision is critical to minimizing failure-induced accidents. Additionally, DenseSSD was observed to be highly insensitive to the environmental changes, maintaining its high precision under the variations of solution colors or testing view angles. The robustness of DenseSSD would allow the utilized equipment settings to be more flexible. This work demonstrates that DenseSSD is useful for enhancing safety in an automated material synthesis environment, and it can be extended to various applications where high detection accuracy and speed are both needed.},

A colorimetric enzymatic cascade assay was optimised using glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase for the oxidative coupling of aminoantipyrine and chromotropic acid to produce a blue quinoneimine dye with a broad absorbance peaking at 590 nm for the quantification of glucose in solution. For comparison the assay was run in standard 96 well plates with a commercial plate reader. The results show the accurate and reproducible quantification of 0\textendash 10 mM glucose solution using a 3D-printed microfluidic optical device with performance comparable to that of a plate reader assay.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Data science and informatics tools have been proliferating recently within the computational materials science and catalysis fields. This proliferation has spurned the creation of various frameworks for automated materials screening, discovery, and design. Underpinning these frameworks are surrogate models with uncertainty estimates on their predictions. These uncertainty estimates are instrumental for determining which materials to screen next, but the computational catalysis field does not yet have a standard procedure for judging the quality of such uncertainty estimates. Here we present a suite of figures and performance metrics derived from the machine learning community that can be used to judge the quality of such uncertainty estimates. This suite probes the accuracy, calibration, and sharpness of a model quantitatively. We then show a case study where we judge various methods for predicting density-functional-theory-calculated adsorption energies. Of the methods studied here, we find that the best performer is a model where a convolutional neural network is used to supply features to a Gaussian process regressor, which then makes predictions of adsorption energies along with corresponding uncertainty estimates.},

  abstract = {The increasing integration of software and automation in modern chemical laboratories prompts special emphasis on two important skills in the chemistry classroom. First, students need to learn the technical skills involved in modern scientific computing and automation. Second, applying these techniques in practice requires effective collaboration in teams. This work aims at developing a teaching module to help students gain both skills. In particular, we describe a modular and collaborative approach for introducing undergraduate students to scientific computing in the context of automated and autonomous chemical laboratories. Using online collaboration tools, students work in parallel teams to develop central components of an automated computer vision system that monitors color changes in ongoing chemical reactions. These components include three different aspects: image capture, communication, and data visualization. The image capture team collects and stores the images of the chemical reaction, the communication team processes the images, and the visualization team develops the tools for analyzing the processed image data. Using this educational framework, students built an open-source Python tool called AutoVis that enables the automated tracking of color and intensity changes in a liquid. The software is tested by simulating chemical reactions with dilute solutions of food coloring in water. It is shown that the system reliably tracks color and intensity, providing feedback to the experimentalist and enabling further computational analysis. Over the course of the project, students gain proficiency in scientific computing using Python and collaborate on software development using GitHub. In this way, they learn the role of software in chemical laboratories of the future.},

  abstract = {Scientific reproducibility has been at the forefront of many news stories and there exist numerous initiatives to help address this problem. We posit that a contributor is simply a lack of specificity that is required to enable adequate research reproducibility. In particular, the inability to uniquely identify research resources, such as antibodies and model organisms, makes it difficult or impossible to reproduce experiments even where the science is otherwise sound. In order to better understand the magnitude of this problem, we designed an experiment to ascertain the ``identifiability'' of research resources in the biomedical literature. We evaluated recent journal articles in the fields of Neuroscience, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Cell and Molecular Biology and General Biology, selected randomly based on a diversity of impact factors for the journals, publishers, and experimental method reporting guidelines. We attempted to uniquely identify model organisms (mouse, rat, zebrafish, worm, fly and yeast), antibodies, knockdown reagents (morpholinos or RNAi), constructs, and cell lines. Specific criteria were developed to determine if a resource was uniquely identifiable, and included examining relevant repositories (such as model organism databases, and the Antibody Registry), as well as vendor sites. The results of this experiment show that 54\% of resources are not uniquely identifiable in publications, regardless of domain, journal impact factor, or reporting requirements. For example, in many cases the organism strain in which the experiment was performed or antibody that was used could not be identified. Our results show that identifiability is a serious problem for reproducibility. Based on these results, we provide recommendations to authors, reviewers, journal editors, vendors, and publishers. Scientific efficiency and reproducibility depend upon a research-wide improvement of this substantial problem in science today.},

Materials are generally evaluated in a singular fashion, relying largely on human-driven compositional choices and analysis of the volumes of generated data, thus also slowing validation of computational models. To overcome these limitations, we developed a high-throughput rapid experimental alloy development (HT-READ) methodology that comprises an integrated, closed-loop material screening process inspired by broad chemical assays and modern innovations in automation. Our method is a general framework unifying computational identification of ideal candidate materials, fabrication of sample libraries in a configuration amenable to multiple tests and processing routes, and analysis of the candidate materials in a high-throughput fashion. An artificial intelligence agent is used to find connections between compositions and material properties. New experimental data can be leveraged in subsequent iterations or new design objectives. The sample libraries are assigned unique identifiers and stored to make data and samples persistent, thus preventing institutional knowledge loss.},

  abstract = {Autonomous physical science is revolutionizing materials science. In these systems, machine learning controls experiment design, execution, and analysis in a closed loop. Active learning, the machine learning field of optimal experiment design, selects each subsequent experiment to maximize knowledge toward the user goal. Autonomous system performance can be further improved with implementation of scientific machine learning, also known as inductive bias-engineered artificial intelligence, which folds prior knowledge of physical laws (e.g., Gibbs phase rule) into the algorithm. As the number, diversity, and uses for active learning strategies grow, there is an associated growing necessity for real-world reference datasets to benchmark strategies. We present a reference dataset and demonstrate its use to benchmark active learning strategies in the form of various acquisition functions. Active learning strategies are used to rapidly identify materials with optimal physical properties within a ternary materials system. The data is from an actual Fe-Co-Ni thin-film library and includes previously acquired experimental data for materials compositions, X-ray diffraction patterns, and two functional properties of magnetic coercivity and the Kerr rotation. Popular active learning methods along with a recent scientific active learning method are benchmarked for their materials optimization performance. We discuss the relationship between algorithm performance, materials search space complexity, and the incorporation of prior knowledge.},

This will enable the development of treatments for diseases currently neglected for economic reasons, such as tropical and orphan diseases, and generally increase the supply of new drugs.

A Robot Scientist is a laboratory automation system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to discover scientific knowledge through cycles of experimentation. Eve integrates and automates library-screening, hit-confirmation, and lead generation through cycles of quantitative structure activity relationship learning and testing. Using econometric modelling we demonstrate that the use of AI to select compounds economically outperforms standard drug screening. For further efficiency Eve uses a standardized form of assay to compute Boolean functions of compound properties. These assays can be quickly and cheaply engineered using synthetic biology, enabling more targets to be assayed for a given budget. Eve has repositioned several drugs against specific targets in parasites that cause tropical diseases. One validated discovery is that the anti-cancer compound TNP-470 is a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase from the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium vivax.},

Recent developments in materials acceleration platforms promise to accelerate materials discovery using automation of experiments coupled with machine learning. However, most of the automation efforts in chemistry focus on synthesis and compound identification, with integrated target property characterization receiving less attention. In this work, we introduce an automated platform for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. Our platform encompassed automated lego-like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end-to-end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, we have discovered 8 potential candidates for organic lasers. We tested the lasing threshold of 4 molecules in thin-film devices and found 2 molecules with state-of-the-art performance. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.},

  abstract = {Synthesis of materials with desired structures, e.g., metal- organic frameworks (MOFs), involves optimization of highly complex chemical and reaction spaces due to multiple choices of chemical elements and reaction parameters/routes. Traditionally, realizing such an aim requires rapid screening of these nonlinear spaces by experimental conduction with human intuition, which is quite inefficient and may cause errors or bias. In this work, we report a platform that integrates a synthesis robot with the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to accelerate the synthesis of MOFs. This robotic platform consists of a direct laser writing apparatus, precursor injecting and Joule-heating components. It can automate the MOFs synthesis upon fed reaction parameters that are recommended by the BO algorithm. Without any prior knowledge, this integrated platform continuously improves the crystallinity of ZIF-67, a demo MOF employed in this study, as the number of operation iterations increases. This work represents a methodology enabled by a data-driven synthesis robot, which achieves the goal of material synthesis with targeted structures, thus greatly shortening the reaction time and reducing energy consumption. It can be easily generalized to other material systems, thus paving a new route to the autonomous discovery of a variety of materials in a cost-effective way in the future.},

A key difficulty when applying ML in Materials Science is that experimental datasets of material properties tend to be small. In this work we show how material descriptors can be learned from the structures present in large scale datasets of material simulations; and how these descriptors can be used to improve the prediction of an experimental property, the energy of formation of a solid. The material descriptors are learned by training a Graph Neural Network to regress simulated formation energies from a material's atomistic structure. Using these learned features for experimental property predictions outperforms existing methods that are based solely on chemical composition. Moreover, we find that the advantage of our approach increases as the generalization requirements of the task are made more stringent, for example when limiting the amount of training data or when generalizing to unseen chemical spaces.},

  abstract = {Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid, diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation metrics for the broader machine learning community.},

However, the number of known materials deposited in the popular materials databases such as ICSD and Materials Project is extremely limited and consists of just a tiny portion of the vast chemical design space. Herein, we present an active generative inverse design method that combines active learning with a deep autoencoder neural network and a generative adversarial deep neural network model to discover new materials with a target property in the whole chemical design space. The application of this method has allowed us to discover new thermodynamically stable materials with high band gap (SrYF5) and semiconductors with specified band gap ranges (SrClF3, CaClF5, YCl3, SrC2F3, AlSCl, As2O3), all of which are verified by the first-principles DFT calculations. Our experiments show that while active learning itself may sample chemically infeasible candidates, these samples help to train effective screening models for filtering out materials with desired properties from the hypothetical materials created by the generative model. The experiments show the effectiveness of our active generative inverse design approach. The source code can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/glard/Active-Generative-Design.},

To tackle the perception challenges posed by transparent objects, we propose TranspareNet, a joint point cloud and depth completion method, with the ability to complete the depth of transparent objects in cluttered and complex scenes, even with partially filled fluid contents within the vessels. To address the shortcomings of existing transparent object data collection schemes in literature, we also propose an automated dataset creation workflow that consists of robot-controlled image collection and vision-based automatic annotation.

Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that TranspareNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods on multiple datasets, including ClearGrasp, and that it also handles cluttered scenes when trained on TODD.

Together with an adaptive design framework, we show that iteratively learning and improving the statistical model can accelerate the search for SMAs with targeted transformation temperatures.

  abstract = {As a promising candidate for accident tolerant fuels, the UO2\textendash Mo composite with continuous Mo channel gains a distinct improvement in the thermal conductivity (TC) of UO2 fuels to enhance the safety and economy of re\- actors. However, due to a large difference between the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of UO2 matrix and Mo channel, microcracks induced by thermal stress usually occur in the matrix of the UO2\textendash Mo composite with a high Mo content. In this paper, it is proved that adding Nb into Mo channel could significantly modify the CTE, hence reduce the thermal stress of matrix (MTS). However, under the constant proportion of additive materials, increasing Nb simultaneously decreases the TC of the whole composite due to its lower TC than that of Mo. To balance this contradiction and search an optimizing composition range, a bi-objective optimization method for material properties was proposed. Two models for predicting TC and MTS of the UO2\textendash Mo\textendash Nb composite were constructed using Gaussian Process Regression, based on the dataset with uncertainty built by finite element simulation. Leveraging the two models and NSGA-II method, an optimizing composition range of the UO2\textendash Mo\textendash Nb composite was obtained. According to the range, a UO2 composite containing 3 vol\% Mo and 1 vol \% Nb was fabricated, which exhibited a TC around 30\% higher than that of UO2 at 1000 {$\smwhtcircle$}C and no microcracks due to the moderate MTS.},

  abstract = {Although machine learning has gained great success in industry, there are still many challenges in mining industrial data, especially in manufacturing domains. Because industrial data can be 1) shallow and wide, 2) highly heterogeneous and sparse. Particularly, mining on sparse data (i.e. data with missing features) is extremely challenging, because it is not easy to fill in some features (e.g. images), and removing data points would reduce the data size further. Thus, in this work, we propose a machine learning framework including transfer learning, heterogeneous feature fusion, principal component analysis and gradient boosting to solve these challenges and effectively develop predictive models on industrial datasets. Compared to a non-fusion method and a traditional fusion method on two real world datasets from Toyota Motor Corporation, the results show that the proposed method can not only maximize the utility of available features and data to achieve more stable and better performance, but also give more flexibility when predicting new unseen data points with only partial set of features available.(Code and data are available at: https://github.com/zyz293/FusionML.)},

  abstract = {Uranium dioxide (UO2) is widely used in nuclear reactors. Low thermal conductivity (TC) is one of its greatest disadvantages. Improving the TC of the UO2 pellet has great significance to the safety and economy of the reactors. Introducing Mo with a continuous distribution into the UO2 matrix can obviously improve the TC of the UO2 pellet. However, considering uranium density, burn-up and postprocessing of the composite pellet, which determine the economy of the nuclear fuel, it is anticipated that the addition of the second phase is as little as possible for the UO2 composite, which is key to further improving the TC of the UO2-Mo composite with a low and constant content of Mo. This target can be achieved by optimizing the microstructure of the composite. In this work, a new method similar to `PixelMapPaint' was introduced for modelling the UO2-Mo composite with a complex microstructure. The effects of various structural characteristics on the TC of the UO2-Mo composite were quickly analysed via the finite element method and machine learning methods. Guided by the analysis results, the actual UO2-Mo pellet with 2 vol\% Mo was fabricated with measured TC higher by approximately 20\% than that of pure UO2. Additionally, the machine learning model was further developed from isotropic to anisotropic composites, with less than 10\% relative error between predicted and simulated TCs in different directions.},

Starting with a 13-mer natural AMP, we identified 44 highly potent peptides, achieving up to a ca. 160-fold increase in antimicrobial activity within just three rounds of experiments. During these experiments, the conformation of the peptides selected was changed from a random coil to an a-helical form. This strategy not only establishes the potential of in vitro molecule evolution using an algorithmic genetic system but also accelerates the discovery of antimicrobial peptides and other functional molecules within a relatively small number of experiments, allowing the exploration of broad sequence and structural space.},

However, small imbalanced data and weak generalizability learning algorithm are two main challenges from the data and model view of points. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning algorithm with augmentation data preprocessing to deal with the small imbalanced data and multi-target predictions. For experiments, we use negative thermal expansion materials as an example. Three targets, starting temperature T1, ending temperature T2, and the negative expansion coefficient {$\alpha$} are prediction targets. The experimental results indicate that, firstly, after data augmentation, the prediction accuracy of all three targets are improved. More\- over, a few rounds of data augmentation can improve the prediction accuracy, but with more augmentation runs, it results in accuracy decreasing. Secondly, comparing with support vector regression and random forest, multitask learning has achieved the best prediction accuracy in T1, T2, and {$\alpha$}. The detailed R2 of T1, T2, and {$\alpha$} are 0.8224, 0.8795 and 0.8984 respectively, which indicates multi-task learning a great potential in broad appli\- cations in future.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic colorimetric biosensors have shown promising potential for detecting metal cations, anions, organic dyes, drugs, pesticides. As for today, most colorimetric sensors are read by a smartphone or professional optical imaging system, and there is still a lack of an affordable and reliable colorimetric detector for the microfluidic chip. Integrating those reading and detection capabilities into a microfluidic system is essential for point-of-care (POC) detection and can enable more complex microfluidic operations, such as lab-on-a-chip experiments or programmable microfluidics. We developed an open-source colorimetric detection sensor board that can be integrated into the existing microfluidic system. This sensor board has a built-in UV source that enables fluorescence detection. With built-in USB and Wi-Fi connectivity and a set of simple APIs, microfluidic systems can communicate directly with this sensor board, even wirelessly. The sensor was designed for low-cost. With a total build cost of less than 12 EUR per unit, it is ideal for low-cost systems and DIY microfluidic users. Along with the sensor board, we also designed a companion microfluidic chip carrier cartridge which can be modified depending on the chip's dimension. To demonstrate the sensor, we also developed a cross-platform open-source client application to demonstrate the communication APIs and the functionality of the sensor board.},

  abstract = {Variations of constituent fiber and matrix properties and process conditions can cause significant variability in composite parts and affect their performance. The focus of this paper is to establish a new computational framework that can efficiently quantify the uncertainty propagation of parts manufactured through the resin transfer molding (RTM) process. RTM involves a sequence of inter-related processes that span multiple spatial and temporal scales. This calls for a multi-scale analysis for the nominal process, which is computationally complex and intensive. A direct Monte Carlo simulation of uncertainty quantification leads to prohibitive cost. In this research we leverage a sequentially architected multi-response Gaussian process (MRGP) meta-modelling approach to facilitate a hierarchical procedure. This can dramatically reduce the computational cost, and allow us to characterize the process outputs of interest at different scales and at the same time capture the intrinsic correlation amongst these outputs. Moreover, integrating a global sensitivity analysis with the hierar\- chical MRGP meta-models yields the importance ranking of uncertainty propagation paths. This computational framework provides a quantitative assessment tool of the uncertainties in composite manufacturing. Case study on curing-induced dimensional variability of a curved composite part is conducted for demonstration and validation.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in machine learning methods, and the emerging availability of programmable interfaces for scanning probe microscopes (SPMs), have propelled automated and autonomous microscopies to the forefront of attention of the scientific community. However, enabling automated microscopy requires the development of task-specific machine learning methods, understanding the interplay between physics discovery and machine learning, and fully defined discovery workflows. This, in turn, requires balancing the physical intuition and prior knowledge of the domain scientist with rewards that define experimental goals and machine learning algorithms that can translate these to specific experimental protocols. Here, we discuss the basic principles of Bayesian active learning and illustrate its applications for SPM. We progress from the Gaussian Process as a simple data-driven method and Bayesian inference for physical models as an extension of physics-based functional fits to more complex deep kernel learning methods, structured Gaussian Processes, and hypothesis learning. These frameworks allow for the use of prior data, the discovery of specific functionalities as encoded in spectral data, and exploration of physical laws manifesting during the experiment. The discussed framework can be universally applied to all techniques combining imaging and spectroscopy, SPM methods, nanoindentation, electron microscopy and spectroscopy, and chemical imaging methods, and can be particularly impactful for destructive or irreversible measurements.},

  abstract = {In multi-objective decision planning and learning, much attention is paid to producing optimal solution sets that contain an optimal policy for every possible user preference profile. We argue that the step that follows, i.e, determining which policy to execute by maximising the user's intrinsic utility function over this (possibly infinite) set, is under-studied. This paper aims to fill this gap. We build on previous work on Gaussian processes and pairwise comparisons for preference modelling, extend it to the multi-objective decision support scenario, and propose new ordered preference elicitation strategies based on ranking and clustering. Our main contribution is an in-depth evaluation of these strategies using computer and human-based experiments. We show that our proposed elicitation strategies outperform the currently used pairwise methods, and found that users prefer ranking most. Our experiments further show that utilising monotonicity information in GPs by using a linear prior mean at the start and virtual comparisons to the nadir and ideal points, increases performance. We demonstrate our decision support framework in a real-world study on traffic regulation, conducted with the city of Amsterdam.},

  abstract = {Sharing information among multiple learning agents can accelerate learning. It could be particularly useful if learners operate in continuously changing environments, because a learner could benefit from previous experience of another learner to adapt to their new environment. Such group-adaptive learning has numerous applications, from predicting financial time-series, through content recommendation systems, to visual understanding for adaptive autonomous agents. Here we address the problem in the context of online adaptive learning. We formally define the learning settings of Group Online Adaptive Learning and derive an algorithm named Shared Online Adaptive Learning (SOAL) to address it. SOAL avoids explicitly modeling changes or their dynamics, and instead shares information continuously. The key idea is that learners share a common small pool of experts, which they can use in a weighted adaptive way. We define group adaptive regret and prove that SOAL maintains known bounds on the adaptive regret obtained for single adaptive learners. Furthermore, it quickly adapts when learning tasks are related to each other. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach for two domains: vision and text. First, in the visual domain, we study a visual navigation task where a robot learns to navigate based on outdoor video scenes. We show how navigation can improve when knowledge from other robots in related scenes is available. Second, in the text domain, we create a new dataset for the task of assigning submitted papers to relevant editors. This is, inherently, an adaptive learning task due to the dynamic nature of research fields evolving in time. We show how learning to assign editors improves when knowledge from other editors is available. Together, these results demonstrate the benefits for sharing information across learners in concurrently changing environments.},
